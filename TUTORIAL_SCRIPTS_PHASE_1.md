## Video 1: Welcome to Madison Studio

**Duration:** 6:00  
**Target Audience:** Brand new users (first-time login)  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Key Features Highlighted:** Dashboard, Brand Health, Image Studio intro

### Script

**[0:00-0:20] OPENING HOOK**

- **Visual:** Elegant fade-in to login screen, then dashboard reveal
- **Narration:** "Welcome to Madison Studio - where your brand's voice becomes unstoppable content. I'm [Your Name], and in the next six minutes, I'll show you how Madison transforms scattered ideas into a consistent, powerful editorial presence. Let's dive in."

**[0:20-1:00] WHAT IS MADISON STUDIO**

- **Visual:** Slow pan across dashboard showing different sections lighting up
- **Narration:** "Madison Studio is your AI-powered editorial team. Think of Madison as your creative director, brand guardian, and production assistant rolled into one. You're looking at your command center - the dashboard. Everything you need to create, schedule, and publish brand-aligned content lives here. Notice these key areas: Brand Health at the top, your content pipeline in the center, and editorial accolades on the right. We'll explore each one, but first - let's talk about your brand."

**[1:00-2:00] YOUR BRAND FOUNDATION (NEW FEATURE: BRAND HEALTH)**

- **Visual:** Click Brand Health card, show score animation (78% → 85% example)
- **Narration:** "See this number? That's your Brand Health Score - one of our newest and most powerful features. It analyzes your brand documentation and tells you exactly how complete and consistent your foundation is. A score of 78% means you're on the right track, but there are gaps Madison can't fully understand yet. Click 'View Full Analysis' and you'll see exactly what's missing - maybe it's your target audience demographics, or your core brand values. Every gap you fill makes Madison smarter about your brand. We'll dive deep into Brand Health in Video 3, but know this: a strong score means better AI suggestions, more on-brand content, and less manual editing."

**[2:00-3:15] THE CONTENT CREATION SUITE**

- **Visual:** Quick tour - hover over "Forge," "Multiply," "Image Studio"
- **Narration:** "Madison has three core creation tools. The Forge is where you write long-form master content - blog posts, newsletters, thought leadership pieces. Multiply takes that master content and transforms it into derivative formats - social posts, email snippets, LinkedIn articles - automatically. And here's the exciting new addition: Madison Image Studio. This is your AI product photography suite. Upload a product photo or describe a scene, and Madison generates brand-aligned, professional-quality images for your marketing. Desert backdrop? Golden hour lighting? Marble surfaces? All possible in minutes. We'll explore Image Studio in detail later, but it's a game-changer for brands without expensive photo shoots."

**[3:15-4:00] EDITORIAL GAMIFICATION**

- **Visual:** Highlight Streak Tracker and Accolades
- **Narration:** "Here's something unique: Madison gamifies your publishing. This Streak Tracker shows consecutive days you've published content. Publish today, publish tomorrow - that's a 2-day streak. Keep it going and watch your motivation climb. Over here, your Editorial Accolades track total published pieces. You start as a 'Novice Scribe' with 1 piece and work your way up to 'Literary Master' at 100 pieces. These aren't just vanity metrics - they keep you accountable and turn content creation into a rewarding habit."

**[4:00-5:00] MADISON, YOUR AI ASSISTANT**

- **Visual:** Open Madison chat panel, show quick interaction
- **Narration:** "Meet Madison - your AI editor and creative partner. She knows your brand voice, your visual standards, and your content goals. Need help refining a headline? Ask Madison. Want to check if a post matches your brand tone? Madison's got you. She's available everywhere - in the Forge, in Image Studio, even when reviewing your archives. Think of her as your editorial safety net and creative brainstorming partner rolled into one."

**[5:00-5:45] THE WORKFLOW**

- **Visual:** Animated flow: Brand Setup → Create → Multiply → Schedule → Publish
- **Narration:** "Here's the Madison workflow in 30 seconds: First, set up your brand - upload guidelines, define your voice, fill in those Brand Health gaps. Next, create master content in the Forge. Then, multiply that content into derivative formats for social, email, and more. Schedule it on the calendar. Publish. Rinse and repeat. The more you publish, the smarter Madison gets about your unique voice."

**[5:45-6:00] CLOSING & CALL TO ACTION**

- **Visual:** Return to dashboard, highlight "Create New Content" button
- **Narration:** "That's Madison Studio in six minutes. Your next step? Head to Settings and complete your brand profile - target that 90% Brand Health Score. Then, create your first piece of content. Click 'Create New Content' when you're ready. Madison's waiting to help you build something remarkable. Let's get started."

## Video 2: Setting Up Your Brand Identity

**Duration:** 7:30  
**Target Audience:** New users completing initial setup  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Key Features Highlighted:** Brand guidelines upload, visual standards, Industry templates

### Script

**[0:00-0:20] INTRO**

- **Visual:** Navigate to Settings → Brand Guidelines tab
- **Narration:** "Your brand isn't just a logo - it's your voice, your values, your visual language. Madison needs to understand all of it to create truly aligned content. In this video, we'll set up your complete brand identity in Madison Studio. By the end, you'll have a 90%+ Brand Health Score and Madison will know your brand as well as you do."

**[0:20-1:15] WHY BRAND SETUP MATTERS**

- **Visual:** Show side-by-side comparison: generic AI content vs brand-aligned Madison content
- **Narration:** "Here's the difference a strong brand setup makes. On the left, generic AI output that could be for any company. On the right, Madison-generated content that sounds exactly like your brand. The secret? Everything we're about to configure. Madison uses your brand guidelines, visual standards, tone of voice, and values to inform every suggestion. Skip this step, and Madison is guessing. Complete it, and Madison becomes an extension of your team."

**[1:15-2:30] UPLOADING BRAND DOCUMENTS**

- **Visual:** Navigate to Brand Guidelines, show upload interface
- **Narration:** "Let's start with your existing brand documentation. Click 'Upload Brand Document' and drag in your brand guidelines PDF, style guide, or any document that defines your brand. Madison supports PDFs, Word docs, text files, and Markdown. Watch the progress bar - Madison is reading and extracting key information: your brand colors, fonts, voice guidelines, prohibited language, even visual do's and don'ts. Once uploaded, you'll see a preview of what Madison extracted. Check it for accuracy. This document becomes Madison's north star for all content creation."

**[2:30-4:00] VISUAL STANDARDS FOR AI IMAGE GENERATION (NEW FEATURE)**

- **Visual:** Scroll to "Visual Standards for AI Image Generation" card, upload example PDF
- **Narration:** "Here's a powerful new feature: Visual Standards for AI images. If you have photography guidelines - lighting rules, forbidden elements, color palettes for product shots - upload them here. Let's say you have a rule: 'Never use glossy surfaces, always matte.' Or 'Golden hour lighting only, no harsh shadows.' Madison Image Studio will enforce these rules automatically when generating images. I'll upload our sample visual standards document. Watch Madison process it - she's extracting your golden rule, mandatory color palette with hex codes, lighting standards, approved templates, and forbidden elements. Now, when you ask Madison to generate a product image, she'll reference these standards and warn you if something breaks the rules. It's like having a creative director built into your image generator."

**[4:00-5:15] DEFINING BRAND VOICE & TONE**

- **Visual:** Navigate to Brand Voice section, fill in fields
- **Narration:** "Next, your brand voice - how you sound across all content. Is your brand professional and authoritative? Friendly and approachable? Playful and irreverent? Define it here. Use the 'Brand Voice Description' field to explain your tone in detail. For example: 'We speak directly to our audience using conversational language. We avoid jargon and corporate buzzwords. Our tone is warm but knowledgeable, like a trusted friend who happens to be an expert.' Now add Do's and Don'ts. Do use contractions? Do speak in first-person plural? Don't use exclamation points? Don't use industry jargon? The more specific, the better Madison can replicate your voice."

**[5:15-6:15] CORE VALUES & MESSAGING**

- **Visual:** Fill in Core Values, Mission, Vision fields
- **Narration:** "Your brand values aren't just wall art - they inform every piece of content you create. Add your 3-5 core values here. Maybe it's 'Sustainability, Transparency, Innovation.' Then add your mission statement - what you're trying to accomplish. And your vision - where you're heading. Madison uses these to ensure your content aligns with what you stand for. If you write a blog post that contradicts a core value, Madison will flag it. If a social post doesn't reflect your mission, she'll suggest revisions. This is brand consistency on autopilot."

**[6:15-7:00] INDUSTRY TEMPLATES & CUSTOMIZATION**

- **Visual:** Show Industry Selector, preview templates for selected industry
- **Narration:** "Madison comes with pre-built templates for dozens of industries - e-commerce, SaaS, consulting, fashion, wellness, you name it. Select your industry and Madison loads relevant content templates, suggested collections, and recommended workflows. These templates aren't locked in - they're starting points you can fully customize. Click 'Preview Templates' to see what's available for your industry. Like what you see? Click 'Apply.' Don't like it? Build your own from scratch."

**[7:00-7:30] CLOSING & NEXT STEPS**

- **Visual:** Show updated Brand Health Score jumping from 45% to 92%
- **Narration:** "Look at that - your Brand Health Score just jumped from 45% to 92%. You've given Madison everything she needs to understand your brand deeply. Now she'll create content that actually sounds like you. Your next step: watch Video 3 to learn how to monitor and improve your Brand Health Score over time. Then, head to the Forge and create your first piece of brand-aligned content. You've built the foundation - now let's create."

## Video 3: Understanding Brand Guidelines & Health Score

**Duration:** 8:00  
**Target Audience:** Users who have uploaded brand docs  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Key Features Highlighted:** Brand Health Score, Gap Wizard, Score History, Visual Standards

### Script

**[0:00-0:25] INTRO**

- **Visual:** Navigate to Brand Health page, show loading then score reveal
- **Narration:** "Your Brand Health Score is Madison's report card on how well she understands your brand. A high score means consistent, on-brand content every time. A low score means gaps - missing information that forces Madison to guess. In this video, we'll explore the Brand Health system, learn how to fix gaps with the Gap Wizard, and understand how visual standards influence AI image generation."

**[0:25-1:30] ANATOMY OF THE BRAND HEALTH SCORE**

- **Visual:** Highlight overall score, show color indicators (green 90%+, yellow 70-90%, red <70%)
- **Narration:** "Your score is a percentage from 0 to 100, calculated by analyzing completeness across six core categories: Brand Voice, Visual Identity, Core Values, Target Audience, Product Information, and Market Position. Each category has critical components - some required, some recommended. A score above 90% is excellent and shown in green - Madison has everything she needs. Between 70-90% is good, shown in yellow - mostly complete with a few gaps. Below 70% is red - urgent attention needed. Your score updates instantly when you add or update brand information. Think of it like a health checkup for your brand documentation."

**[1:30-2:45] CATEGORY BREAKDOWN & PRIORITIES**

- **Visual:** Scroll through Category Progress, expand "Brand Voice" category
- **Narration:** "Let's dive into categories. Click any category to see its breakdown. Here's Brand Voice - it shows Missing components in red, Incomplete items in yellow, and Complete elements in green. See these priority numbers? Priority 1 means 'fix this immediately' - it's blocking Madison from generating accurate content. Priority 6 means 'nice to have but not urgent.' Start with Priority 1 and 2 items for the biggest score boost. Notice 'Target Audience Demographics' is missing with Priority 1. That means Madison doesn't know who you're writing for, so she can't tailor tone appropriately. Let's fix it."

**[2:45-4:15] FIXING GAPS WITH THE GAP WIZARD (NEW FEATURE)**

- **Visual:** Click "Fix This Issue" on a recommendation, Gap Wizard modal opens, fill out form
- **Narration:** "This is the Gap Wizard - your step-by-step assistant for filling brand gaps. Click 'Fix This Issue' on any recommendation to launch it. The wizard shows exactly what's missing and why it matters. See the component name? 'Target Audience Demographics.' The description explains how this strengthens your brand. Now let's fill it in. The form breaks complex concepts into simple questions. 'Who is your primary audience?' I'll type: 'Women aged 25-45, college-educated, interested in sustainable living and wellness products.' Notice the character count - it ensures enough detail without overwhelming. Add any additional context. Now click 'Save to Brand Guidelines.' Watch what happens - the modal closes, and boom, your Brand Health Score updates from 78% to 82%. That's immediate progress. The recommendation disappears because it's now complete. Do this for all Priority 1 and 2 items, and you'll hit 90% fast."

**[4:15-5:30] VISUAL STANDARDS & IMAGE STUDIO INTEGRATION (NEW FEATURE)**

- **Visual:** Navigate back to Settings → Brand Guidelines → Visual Standards section
- **Narration:** "Here's where Brand Health connects to Madison Image Studio. If you've uploaded visual standards - photography rules, lighting mandates, color palettes - Madison enforces them when generating images. Let's look at an example. This uploaded document says: 'Golden Rule: If it looks like an ad, it fails. Use natural, editorial aesthetics only.' It defines a mandatory color palette with specific hex codes like Stone Beige #D8C8A9. It lists forbidden elements: chrome, glossy surfaces, artificial-looking props. Now, when you ask Madison Image Studio to create a product photo, she references these rules. Ask for 'chrome accents' and she'll warn you: 'Hold on, chrome is forbidden in your visual standards. Try aged brass instead.' Request a template and she'll suggest one from your approved list. This prevents off-brand visuals before they're even generated."

**[5:30-6:30] TRACKING PROGRESS WITH SCORE HISTORY (NEW FEATURE)**

- **Visual:** Scroll to Score History chart, hover over data points
- **Narration:** "Your Score History chart tracks improvements over time. Each point represents when you ran a Brand Health analysis. The line trending upward means progress. Hover over any point to see the exact score and date. Most users see gradual improvement - you might start at 65%, fix a few gaps, hit 72%. Upload comprehensive brand docs and jump to 85%. Keep filling in details and reach 92% over a few weeks. When should you re-run the analysis? After uploading new brand documents, after fixing 3-5 gaps with the Gap Wizard, or monthly to check your progress. Don't run it daily - you need time between analyses to make meaningful changes."

**[6:30-7:15] UNDERSTANDING RECOMMENDATIONS VS STRENGTHS**

- **Visual:** Show Recommendations list, then scroll to Strengths section
- **Narration:** "Recommendations tell you what's missing. Strengths show what you're already doing well. Check your Strengths section at the bottom - maybe you have excellent brand voice documentation but weak visual guidelines. Or comprehensive product information but vague core values. Understanding strengths helps you maintain what's working while fixing gaps. These are your foundation - protect them as you grow. Every recommendation has a priority badge and suggested action. High priority = biggest score boost. Medium = important but not urgent. Low = polishing and optimization."

**[7:15-8:00] CLOSING & ACTION STEPS**

- **Visual:** Show full Brand Health page with 90%+ score
- **Narration:** "Brand Health isn't about perfection - it's about progress. Aim for 90% and you'll unlock Madison's full potential. Here's your action plan: Run your first Brand Health analysis if you haven't. Fix all Priority 1 recommendations using the Gap Wizard. Upload any missing brand documents, especially visual standards if you plan to use Image Studio. Re-run the analysis and watch your score climb. Then, track it monthly and maintain that 90%+ score. A strong brand foundation means better AI content, more consistent messaging, and less manual editing. Your brand - and your audience - will feel the difference."
