# HOOKS - Opening Techniques for Premium Copy

## Purpose
Hooks are the opening lines that capture attention and make readers lean in. For premium brands, hooks should be sophisticated, specific, and respect the reader's intelligence.

## Core Principles

### 1. Specificity Over Hype (Ogilvy)
- ❌ "Discover amazing products"
- ✅ "French lavender aged eighteen months before blending"

### 2. Reason-Why Opening (Hopkins)
- Start with a mechanism or process that creates intrigue
- Example: "Oil-based formulas bond with skin warmth, evolving for 8+ hours—unlike alcohol-based fragrances that evaporate within two."

### 3. Unique Claim (Reeves)
- Lead with what only this brand does
- Example: "The only candle studio that test-burns one candle from every batch for 60 hours before anything ships."

### 4. Awareness-Stage Matching (Schwartz)
- **Unaware**: Story or emotional scene that sets up the problem
- **Problem-aware**: Explain the mechanism that solves it
- **Solution-aware**: Lead with your USP
- **Product-aware**: Lead with specificity and proof
- **Most aware**: Short, confident, dignified opening

## Hook Types for Premium Brands

### 1. The Specific Detail Hook
Open with a concrete, surprising detail that proves quality:
- "Eighteen months. That's how long we age French lavender before it touches your skin."
- "Sixty hours of test-burning. One candle from every batch. Before anything ships."

### 2. The Mechanism Hook
Explain how something works in a way that reveals superiority:
- "Oil-based formulas bond with skin warmth, evolving for 8+ hours—unlike alcohol-based fragrances that evaporate within two."
- "Cold-pressed extraction preserves volatile compounds that heat destroys."

### 3. The Contrast Hook
Show what you do differently:
- "While others rush batches, we wait. Eighteen months. Because time is the ingredient you can't fake."
- "Most candles tunnel. Ours don't. Here's why."

### 4. The Story Hook (for Unaware audiences)
Set a scene that creates emotional context:
- "The moment you walk into a room and know, without looking, that someone lit a candle hours ago."
- "There's a difference between a scent that announces itself and one that becomes part of the air."

### 5. The Question Hook (Use Sparingly)
Only if it's genuinely thought-provoking, not rhetorical:
- "What if your fragrance didn't fade—it evolved?"
- "How do you prove a candle burns for 60 hours? You burn one from every batch."

## What to Avoid

❌ Generic questions: "Looking for the perfect gift?"
❌ Hype words: "Revolutionary," "game-changing," "amazing"
❌ Empty promises: "Transform your life"
❌ Screaming urgency: "ACT NOW!!!"
❌ Talking down: "You probably don't know this, but..."
