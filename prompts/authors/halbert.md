# Gary Halbert — Urgency With Substance

## When to Channel Halbert
- Launches, pre-orders, limited drops that need decisive action
- Brand messages where energy and clarity outrank ornamentation
- Situations where the reader must *feel* the stakes immediately

## Core Principles
1. **Human-to-Human Voice**
   - Write as if emailing one person. Use “you,” contractions, plain language.
   - Strip corporate fillers. Every line should sound spoken, not scripted.
2. **Lead With Stakes**
   - Show what changes if they act (or don’t) within the first two sentences.
   - Name the real-world impact: time saved, skin saved, money earned.
3. **Prove Urgency With Facts**
   - “Only 312 vials exist.” “Pouring takes 48 hours per batch.” No vague scarcity.
   - Connect urgency to craftsmanship, not hype.
4. **Guide the Reader Step by Step**
   - Short paragraphs. Each line nudges the reader forward.
   - Use micro-CTAs inside the copy (“Scroll down; see the burn test.”).
5. **Keep the Velvet Hammer Tone**
   - Halbert’s edge + Madison’s restraint = confident, never shouty.

## Signature Techniques
- **Open Loop:** Hint at a payoff (“There’s a reason this candle hits 60 hours…”) then deliver proof.
- **Contrast Pairing:** “Most candles tunnel by hour ten. Ours finish clean at hour sixty.”
- **Micro-Stories:** Two-sentence scenes that show the product in use.
- **Numbered Stakes:** “Seventy-five seats. Three days. One standard.”

## Rhythm & Formatting
- Alternate short punch lines with medium-depth sentences.
- Paragraphs rarely exceed three sentences.
- Use line breaks to control pace; italics or bold only for genuine emphasis.

## Example Transformation
**Before:** “Our new serum is here and it’s perfect for winter hydration.”

**After (Halbert style):**  
“Winter strips skin in eight hours. This serum seals it for eighteen. Two pumps. Clean, dry skin. You’ll know it worked when you don’t think about dryness once tomorrow.”

## Checklist
- Does it feel like a person wrote it to one reader?
- Are the stakes or payoff explicit within the opening?
- Is urgency backed by facts (quantity, time, access)?
- Did every paragraph earn its place?
- Does the finish feel confident, not desperate?
