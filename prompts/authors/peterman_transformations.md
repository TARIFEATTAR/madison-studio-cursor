## HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT

This shows **real transformations** from generic marketing copy → authentic Peterman voice.

Study the **transformation notes** after each example to understand WHY the changes work.

Use these as templates for your own Madison copy generation.

## EXAMPLE 1: LEATHER WALLET

### ❌ BEFORE (Generic Marketing Copy)

"Introducing our premium handcrafted leather wallet. Made from the finest full-grain leather with meticulous attention to detail. Features 8 card slots, bill compartment, and RFID protection. Perfect for the modern gentleman who appreciates quality and style! Available in black, brown, and cognac. Order now and elevate your everyday carry. $95"

**Problems:**
- Announces product immediately
- Generic adjectives ("premium," "finest")
- Marketing jargon ("elevate your everyday carry")
- Exclamation point
- Features list with no story
- "Perfect for modern gentleman" cliché
- Urgency tactic ("Order now")

---

### ✅ AFTER (Peterman Style)

"Stop and think about that wonderful dark pocket of leather in the middle of a baseball glove, lovingly used and punished for half a lifetime. Is it wearing out? Is it getting softer, better?

That's the leather we use. Not from baseball gloves—that would be impractical—but from the same Florentine tannery that's been doing it right since 1887. Each wallet stitched by hand: 16 stitches per inch. The leather arrives already broken in, bearing the character of its tumbling process. Your grandfather would recognize this. He'd nod. He might not say anything, but you'd know.

Eight cards, folded bills, nothing you don't need. The RFID lining is there—invisible, necessary, unobtrusive. Like a good butler.

Price, $95. In saddle brown, black, or cognac."

**What Changed:**
- Opens with sensory question/image (baseball glove)
- Specific detail: "16 stitches per inch," "since 1887"
- Story before product (tannery history)
- Character sketch (grandfather's nod) creates identity connection
- Features woven into narrative ("like a good butler")
- Humor through understatement
- Price last, simple format
- No hype, no urgency, no exclamation

**Techniques Used:**
- Rhetorical question opening
- Specificity stacking (tannery date, stitch count)
- Character development (grandfather)
- Parenthetical aside (baseball gloves impractical)
- Simple statement close

## EXAMPLE 2: WOMEN'S CASHMERE SWEATER

### ❌ BEFORE

"Experience ultimate luxury with our incredibly soft cashmere sweater! This timeless piece features a classic crew neck and ribbed cuffs. Made from 100% Grade A Mongolian cashmere. Machine washable for easy care. Versatile enough to dress up or down. Perfect for any occasion! Available in 8 beautiful colors. Reg. $298, NOW ONLY $198! Limited quantities—order today!"

**Problems:**
- "Ultimate luxury" = meaningless
- Multiple exclamation points
- "Timeless," "classic," "versatile" = empty words
- Urgent discount tactics
- "Perfect for any occasion" = everything/nothing
- No story, no context
- Talking AT customer, not TO them

---

### ✅ AFTER (Peterman Style)

"In the high plateaus of Inner Mongolia, where winter temperatures drop to -40°F, the cashmere goats grow an undercoat so fine that it takes four goats to make one sweater. The herders comb it out by hand each spring—they don't shear, they comb. Slowly. This is why it's soft.

This particular yarn comes from a women's cooperative near Erdenet. Third generation. They card, spin, and dye using methods their grandmothers would recognize. The woman who knit your sweater—her name is on a card inside—has been doing this since she was twelve. She's 47 now.

Crew neck. Long enough to cover what you want covered. Ribbed cuffs that won't stretch out because they're knit separately and joined. (Yes, it adds time. Yes, it matters.) The color they call Camel Brown is actually closer to the color of sand at Gobi Desert sunset, but you don't name colors by committee.

You can wash this in a machine on the wool cycle with cold water, though we can't imagine why you'd want to. Hand wash takes four minutes.

Price, $298. In eight colors including that Gobi brown. Sizes XS-XL."

**What Changed:**
- Opens with place and process (Mongolia, -40°F)
- Specific makers (women's cooperative, knitter's name)
- Explains why it's good (combing vs. shearing)
- Parenthetical commentary adds personality
- Practical details woven in (washing, sizing)
- Price is price—no "only," no urgency
- Story creates value, not adjectives
- Reader learns something interesting

**Techniques Used:**
- Scene-setting (Mongolia, temperature)
- Compressed biography (knitter background)
- Specificity stacking (4 goats, 47 years old, 3rd generation)
- Parenthetical asides (adds time/matters, can't imagine why)
- Sensory detail (Gobi sunset sand)

## EXAMPLE 3: MEN'S FIELD JACKET

### ❌ BEFORE

"Our rugged field jacket is perfect for adventure! Water-resistant canvas with multiple pockets for all your gear. Vintage-inspired military styling meets modern functionality. Comfortable fit, durable construction, timeless design. Great for hiking, camping, or everyday wear. Built to last! Shop now."

**Problems:**
- "Perfect for adventure!" = empty promise
- "Vintage-inspired" but no actual vintage reference
- Feature list without context
- "Built to last" with no proof
- "Timeless" cliché
- No personality, could be any brand

---

### ✅ AFTER (Peterman Style)

"The British called them 'smocks' during the First War—loose canvas pullovers the officers wore over their uniforms in the trenches of the Somme. Not for warmth, though they helped with that. For pockets. Field glasses, maps, compass, writing kit, letters from home. Everything at hand when you needed it, because the trenches were too narrow to wear a pack.

This one isn't a reproduction—it's a rethinking. Same canvas weight (12 oz.), same idea (eight pockets, each placed where you'd actually use it), but cut for someone who isn't running through barbed wire. The left chest pocket fits a Moleskine notebook exactly. The right holds your phone without looking like it was designed to hold your phone. Two at the hips: right for keys, left for whatever you're always losing.

Water-resistant but not waterproof, which is honest. Breaks in rather than breaks down. The arms will show creases at the elbows after a month or so. That's how you know it's working.

Price, $265. In British khaki or field gray. Sizes S-XXL, and yes, we actually measured on real humans with different builds."

**What Changed:**
- Historical context (WWI officers, trenches)
- Explains why it exists (pocket placement problem)
- "Rethinking not reproduction" = honest positioning
- Specific details (12 oz. canvas, Moleskine fit, 8 pockets)
- Anticipates objection (not waterproof, but honest)
- Humor (whatever you're always losing)
- Philosophy (breaks in, not breaks down)
- Price justified through story

**Techniques Used:**
- Historical miniature (WWI smocks)
- Specificity (canvas weight, pocket count, notebook brand)
- Honesty within romance (not waterproof)
- Second-person address (implied "you")
- Simple statement (that's how you know it's working)

## EXAMPLE 4: FOUNTAIN PEN

### ❌ BEFORE

"Discover the art of fine writing with our luxury fountain pen! Features a smooth German nib, elegant design, and comes in a beautiful gift box. Perfect gift for executives, writers, or anyone who appreciates the finer things. Makes a statement at any meeting! Lifetime warranty included. $185"

**Problems:**
- "Luxury" and "elegant" = vague
- "Perfect gift" = says nothing
- "Makes a statement" = what statement?
- "Anyone who appreciates the finer things" = condescending
- No story, no history, no reason

---

### ✅ AFTER (Peterman Style)

"Most people under 40 have never used a fountain pen. They've seen them in movies—signing treaties, writing in leather journals during train journeys through Europe—but they've never held one.

You should.

Not because it's refined or because it makes you look serious in meetings (though it will). Because it changes what writing feels like. You have to slow down. Not much—just enough to make contact with what you're writing instead of transcribing what you're thinking. The nib is German, from Osmiroid, a company that's been making them since 1924. It's slightly softer than their #4 grade, which means your handwriting will look better than it actually is.

The body is turned from a single piece of ebonite—a hard rubber that was used for telephone casings in the 1940s before anyone knew what plastic would become. Weighs almost nothing. Won't crack if you drop it, though we hope you won't.

Comes with a piston converter so you can use bottled ink, plus six cartridges to start. The box is plain cardboard because we spent the money on the pen instead. Lifetime guarantee on the nib, which is where it matters.

Price, $185. In black or Bombay red."

**What Changed:**
- Opens with cultural observation (under 40, movies)
- Direct address: "You should"
- Explains why, not just what (changes writing feel)
- Specific makers (Osmiroid, 1924, #4 grade)
- Material story (ebonite, telephone history)
- Honest about packaging (plain cardboard, money on pen)
- Guarantee positioned as serious, not sales tactic

**Techniques Used:**
- Cultural context (generational observation)
- Direct address (You should)
- Historical connection (telephone casings, 1940s)
- Specificity (Osmiroid, grade #4, 1924)
- Honest aside (plain box, where money went)
- Philosophy (contact with writing vs transcription)

## EXAMPLE 5: TRAVEL DUFFEL BAG

### ❌ BEFORE

"Take your travels to the next level with our premium leather duffel! Spacious main compartment with interior pockets. Adjustable shoulder strap. Genuine full-grain leather. Airport-friendly size. Perfect for weekend getaways or business trips. Sophisticated style that never goes out of fashion. $425"

**Problems:**
- "Take to next level" = meaningless
- "Premium," "sophisticated," "never goes out of fashion" = empty
- Feature list without story
- No reason to believe quality claims
- Generic travel language

---

### ✅ AFTER (Peterman Style)

"The overnight bag that Douglas Fairbanks carried to Tangier in 1926 held: two linen suits, three silk shirts, a bottle of gin disguised as aftershave, and a loaded pistol he never intended to use. The bag itself was more important than what was in it. It said: I travel light because I know where I'm going.

This one says the same thing.

Made in a workshop outside Tuscany where they've been doing leather since leather meant saddles, not accessories. The hides are vegetable-tanned for six months, which means they'll darken and develop character instead of wearing out. One main compartment because you're not the kind of person who needs seventeen organizational pockets. An adjustable strap that's long enough for your shoulder or short enough to carry by hand, depending on whether you want to look like you're rushing.

Fits in the overhead bin on every aircraft except regional props, and if you're flying on regional props, you have bigger problems than your bag. Two outside pockets sized for passport and paperback novel, the things you need without unpacking. Interior pocket for whatever you don't want the security scanner to see—though we assume that's just your grandmother's jewelry.

Price, $425. In cognac brown or black. Both age well."

**What Changed:**
- Opens with character (Douglas Fairbanks, Tangier, 1926)
- Inventory of what he carried adds personality
- "It said..." = product as statement without saying it
- Workshop story (Tuscany, saddles-to-accessories)
- Specific process (6 months vegetable tanning)
- Philosophy (not 17 pockets—you're better than that)
- Practical honesty (regional props problem)
- Humor (grandmother's jewelry)
- Both colors mentioned as aging well (quality signal)

**Techniques Used:**
- Historical character sketch (Douglas Fairbanks)
- Catalog/inventory (what he carried)
- Compressed backstory (workshop history)
- Specificity (6 months, regional props)
- Assumed sophistication (you're not that person)
- Humor through parenthetical

## EXAMPLE 6: WOMEN'S ANKLE BOOTS

### ❌ BEFORE

"Step into style with our luxe ankle boots! Buttery-soft Italian leather with a comfortable 2" heel. Perfect for work or weekend. Versatile enough to pair with anything from jeans to dresses. Quality craftsmanship in every stitch. Available in three gorgeous colors. Treat yourself—you deserve it! $295"

**Problems:**
- "Step into style" = cliché opening
- "Luxe," "buttery-soft," "gorgeous" = generic adjectives
- "You deserve it" = presumptuous
- "Perfect for work or weekend" = says nothing
- Exclamation point
- No story, no maker, no reason

---

### ✅ AFTER (Peterman Style)

"In a workshop in Le Marche, Italy—the boot-making region even Italians respect—there's a man named Giulio who has strong opinions about heels. Two inches, he says. Not two-and-a-quarter, not one-and-three-quarters. Two inches is where your weight falls forward just enough to make you walk differently without making you teeter. He's been making boots for 40 years. We're inclined to believe him.

These boots took him three days, start to finish. The leather comes from Tuscany, tanned for eight months until it's soft enough to feel like it's already been broken in but strong enough to last a decade. He cuts each piece from a paper pattern his father made in 1968. Stitches the uppers by hand, 14 stitches per inch. The soles are Vibram—Italian rubber that won't slip on marble floors or wet sidewalks, though it's thick enough that you can't feel every crack in the pavement.

They'll fit snug at first. After a week, they'll fit perfectly. After a year, they'll fit like they were made for you specifically, which, in a sense, they were.

Price, $295. In cognac brown, black, or charcoal. Sizes 6-11, including half sizes."

**What Changed:**
- Opens with place and person (Giulio in Le Marche)
- Explains why 2" heel specifically (Giulio's opinion)
- Maker biography (40 years, father's pattern from 1968)
- Process details (3 days, 8 months tanning, 14 stitches)
- Practical benefits woven in (Vibram, won't slip)
- Honest about fit progression (snug → perfect → yours)
- Price justified through craft story

**Techniques Used:**
- Character introduction (Giulio)
- Specificity (2 inches, 40 years, 1968 pattern, 14 stitches)
- Maker authority (his opinion validated by experience)
- Process explanation (why soft yet strong)
- Time progression (week → year → lifetime)
- Parenthetical philosophy (in a sense, made for you)

## TRANSFORMATION FORMULA

### STEP 1: Kill the Opening
**Delete:** "Introducing," "Discover," "Experience," "Step into"  
**Replace with:** Story, scene, question, or character

### STEP 2: Find the Real Story
**Ask:**
- Where was this made?
- Who made it?
- Why does it exist?
- What historical precedent?
- What problem did it solve originally?

### STEP 3: Get Specific
**Replace vague with precise:**
- "Premium" → "14 stitches per inch"
- "Quality" → "Vegetable-tanned for 6 months"
- "Comfortable" → "2-inch heel that shifts weight forward just enough"

### STEP 4: Add a Person
**Options:**
- The maker (Giulio, 40 years experience)
- Historical figure (Douglas Fairbanks in Tangier)
- Implied user (your grandfather would nod)
- You, the narrator (I thought...)

### STEP 5: Weave Features
**Transform list into narrative:**
- Not: "Features 8 pockets"
- Yes: "Eight pockets, each placed where you'd actually use it"

### STEP 6: Close Simply
**Delete:** Urgency, hype, calls to action  
**Replace with:** Image, statement, or natural trail-off  
**Then:** Price, sizing, done

---

## COMMON TRANSFORMATIONS

### HYPE → SPECIFICITY
- "Amazing quality!" → "14 stitches per inch, the same count used in pre-war Savile Row"
- "Incredibly soft!" → "Tumbled for 40 hours until it feels broken in"
- "Perfect fit!" → "Cut using a 1968 pattern that's been adjusted exactly twice"

### FEATURES → STORY
- "Water-resistant coating" → "Not waterproof but honest—resists rain for 20 minutes, enough to get to shelter"
- "Multiple pockets" → "Eight pockets because that's how many things you actually need at hand"
- "Durable construction" → "The same leather used in saddles, which take more punishment than you ever will"

### MARKETING SPEAK → PETERMAN VOICE
- "Perfect for the modern man" → "Your grandfather would recognize this"
- "Elevate your style" → "It says: I know what I'm doing"
- "Limited time offer" → [Delete completely]
- "You deserve it" → [Delete completely]

---

## THE TRANSFORMATION TEST

**Take any generic copy and ask:**

1. **Where's the story?** (Must exist)
2. **Who made this?** (Find the maker)
3. **What's the specific detail?** (Numbers, measurements, dates)
4. **Where's the second person?** (Add "you")
5. **What historical context?** (Find the precedent)
6. **Where's the honesty?** (Admit limitations)
7. **What's the simple close?** (Remove hype)

**If you can answer all 7 → You've got Peterman voice**

---

## MADISON IMPLEMENTATION

### WHEN GENERATING COPY:

**Step 1:** Feed Madison the product info + research  
**Step 2:** Specify "Peterman voice"  
**Step 3:** Check output against this document  
**Step 4:** Look for red flags (see Quick Reference)  
**Step 5:** Read aloud—does it sound like a person?  
**Step 6:** Add one specific detail if missing  
**Step 7:** Remove any marketing words that snuck in

### RED FLAG CHECKLIST:

- [ ] No "amazing," "perfect," "luxury"
- [ ] No exclamation points
- [ ] Story before product
- [ ] At least one specific measurement/date/name
- [ ] Price last, simple format
- [ ] Second person used somewhere
- [ ] Sounds like a friend, not a brand

---

## FINAL NOTES

**Remember:**
- Peterman sells identity, not objects
- Story creates desire, features confirm decision
- Specific details build trust more than adjectives
- Honesty within romance is the key
- If it sounds like an ad, you've failed

**The goal:**
Make them want the story first.  
The product is how they get it.

*Transform generic → authentic*  
*Transform features → story*
