5. **Product emerges naturally** (late, from context)
6. **Simple close** (image or statement)
7. **Price last** (Format: "Price, $35.")

2. Would I want to hear this story?
3. Can I picture the scene?
4. Do I trust the narrator?
5. Does product feel natural or forced?
6. Is there anything that sounds "sales-y"?
7. Would this only work for this brand?

**If any answer is "no" → rewrite**

## EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATIONS

### ❌ BEFORE (Generic Copy):
"Our amazing new wallet is made from premium leather and features high-quality stitching. Perfect for the modern man! Available now in multiple colors."

### ✅ AFTER (Peterman Style):
"Stop and think about that wonderful dark pocket of leather in the middle of a baseball glove, lovingly used and punished for half a lifetime. Is it wearing out? Is it getting softer, better? That's the leather we use. Not from baseball gloves—that would be impractical—but from the same tannery that's been doing it right since 1923. Each wallet stitched by hand: 14 stitches per inch. Price, $85. In brown or black."
