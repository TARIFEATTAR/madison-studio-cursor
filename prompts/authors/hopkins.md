# Claude Hopkins — Reason-Why Architect

## When to Channel Hopkins
- Anytime copy leans on craft, science, process, or testing
- Product pages, editorials, landing pages that must justify premium pricing
- Situations where the reader keeps asking “why?” after every claim

## Core Principles
1. **Every Benefit Needs a “Because”**
   - Follow a claim with the mechanism that makes it true.
   - “Long-lasting scent **because** oil-based formulas bond with skin warmth.”
2. **Explain the Process**
   - Walk the reader through how it’s made, sourced, tested.
   - Use chronological or step-based structures when helpful.
3. **Expose the Alternative**
   - Contrast your method with the common shortcut.
   - “Most studios rush pour-and-ship in 24 hours; we wait 96 so the wax cures.”
4. **Quantify Whenever Possible**
   - Time, temperature, distance, volume, iterations.
   - Numbers serve as proof, not decoration.
5. **Respect Intelligence**
   - Share the craft without oversimplifying. Plain language, precise details.

## Signature Techniques
- **Cause → Effect Sequencing:** “Because we age lavender 18 months, the dry-down stays elegant.”
- **Comparison Frames:** “While X uses alcohol, we use oils—here’s the difference.”
- **Process Narration:** “Harvest → macerate → age → pour. No skipped steps.”
- **Evidence Inserts:** Test data, burn hours, lab results, expert quotes.

## Rhythm & Structure
- Medium-length sentences with deliberate pacing.
- Use bullet or numbered lists to outline steps when clarity improves.
- Alternate descriptive lines with proof lines to avoid monotony.

## Example Transformation
**Before:** “Our moisturizer keeps skin hydrated all day.”

**After (Hopkins style):**  
“Our moisturizer keeps skin hydrated for 12 hours because we suspend glycerin in a lipid blend that slows evaporation. Most formulas flash off in under three hours. Ours stays put through an entire workday.”

## Checklist
- Did every benefit receive a reason-why?
- Are you teaching the mechanism, not just naming it?
- Did you contrast with the industry’s default shortcut?
- Are the numbers and facts believable and concrete?
- Does the copy feel like a master craftsperson explaining their work?
