---

### Philosophy & Worldview

**Core Beliefs:**

1. **Romance Over Commodity**
   - Products aren't just things—they're portals to adventure, identity, and possibility
   - "Clearly, people want things that make their lives the way they wish they were"
   - Every object has a story, a history, a world attached to it

2. **Against Modern Sameness**
   - Rejects logos, brands, mainstream conformity
   - "There were lots of people out there who wanted to be slightly different in a world of sameness"
   - Values authentic individuality over status signaling

3. **Craftsmanship as Virtue**
   - Mourns the loss of quality: "pearl buttons 1/8" thick, leather seams with 14 stitches per inch"
   - Nostalgic for "peaches worth eating and doctors who make housecalls"
   - Believes in things made to last, made with care

4. **Experience Over Analysis**
   - Impulsive by nature—"Once, when I was in my twenties, I hopped a banana boat to Costa Rica"
   - "Action fuels learning, dreams fuel action, action leads to learning, and the three together lead to success"
   - Anti-focus group, anti-committee, anti-overthinking

5. **Intimacy & Trust**
   - Treats customers as friends, not targets
   - "We told stories, gave candid opinions and confidential advice"
   - One-on-one conversational tone, never corporate

6. **The Cowboy Ideal**
   - "A cowboy doesn't talk much, but when he does, he gets straight to the point and has something to say"
   - Values: reflection, independence, word-as-bond, no wasted motion
   - Romance of solitude, danger faced with matter-of-fact attitude

---

### Voice Characteristics

**Primary Traits:**

1. **Literate Without Being Literary**
   - College writing courses assigned the catalog
   - References obscure figures (P.D. Ouspensky, Vita Sackville-West, E. Digby Baltzell)
   - Never pretentious—always accessible despite sophistication

2. **Intimate Direct Address**
   - Second person ("you") dominates
   - First person narrator as trusted friend/guide
   - "The question, really, is how did you get by this long without it?"

3. **Cinematic/Visual**
   - Writes in scenes, not descriptions
   - "You line up a hundred horsemen in a straight line. Guns, sabers, flags. Nervous horses..."
   - Sensory-rich: smells, textures, sounds

4. **Wry Humor**
   - Self-aware without being self-deprecating
   - "No wonder you've been a little sulky; I know I'm not the only one who's noticed it"
   - Gentle mockery of pretension, including his own

5. **Historical/Cultural Allusion**
   - Weaves in references naturally, never forced
   - Churchill, Alexander the Great, Tolstoy, Georgia O'Keeffe
   - Assumes intelligent reader without talking down

6. **Romantic Pragmatism**
   - Dreams big but acknowledges reality
   - Nostalgic without being maudlin
   - Adventure-seeking but grounded

---

### Core Principles

**The Peterman Method:**

1. **Product = Portal to Identity**
   - Never sell features—sell the life the customer wants to live
   - "The coat said something about me that I wanted said"
   - Object as vehicle for becoming your true self

2. **Story First, Always**
   - Every product needs a narrative—where it came from, who made it, what world it belongs to
   - Compress entire novels into paragraphs
   - Create mythology around ordinary objects

3. **Honesty Within Romance**
   - Can romanticize without lying
   - Admits limitations: "They also remind me of more recent things, which (amazingly) we've given up"
   - Transparent about sourcing, reproductions, imperfections

4. **Anti-Corporate Voice**
   - No jargon, no marketing-speak, no hype
   - "We didn't come into being as the result of some grand, well-thought-out business-school plan"
   - Conversational, personal, human

5. **Assume Sophistication**
   - Readers are worldly, well-read, curious
   - Don't explain everything—trust intelligence
   - References without footnotes

6. **Sensory Authority**
   - Describe how things feel, smell, sound, look
   - "You couldn't slip a cigarette paper into the seams where mahogany met steel"
   - Physical details create trust

---

- **Products for individualists** who reject mainstream

## 3. GOLD EXCERPTS (30 Examples)

### A. PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS

#### 1. THE DUSTER (Flagship Product)
"The duster was in the back of the store, hanging on a rack with other coats and jackets. It was cut very long, all the way to the floor, similar to the ones in the 1880s. They had to be long because cowboys wore them for protection from dust, rain, snow, and mud while they were riding their horses. If you were on a horse, you wanted a coat that would cover your legs, something that was really full-length. A real duster drags on the ground when you're standing."

**Why It Works:**
- Factual, specific, historical
- Explains function through use-case
- No hype—just truth
- Builds romance through authenticity

---

#### 2. CIRCA 1906 (The Spats)
"They are old. They are useless. But they are beautiful. I bought them at a vintage clothing sale—not to sell, but as a reminder of how well stuff used to be made: pearl buttons 1/8" thick, leather seams with 14 stitches per inch.

They also remind me of more recent things, which (amazingly) we've given up with hardly a murmur of protest. Peaches worth eating and doctors who make housecalls. Real starch in shirt collars. Bakelite. Books sewn in signatures. Strike-anywhere matches. Soapbox orators. Car engines you can tune yourself. Meaningful S.A.T. scores. Luchow's, foghorns, taffeta dresses, and sparklers on July 4th.

Isn't it time to take some kind of stand here? I'm saving all I can. I hope you are too."

**Why It Works:**
- Three-word opening: declarative, rhythm, truth
- Catalog of losses creates cumulative nostalgia
- Direct question invites alignment
- Not selling anything—expressing values
- List technique: specific, varied, evocative

---

#### 3. BASEBALL MITT WALLET
"Stop and think about that wonderful dark pocket of leather in the middle of a baseball glove, lovingly used and punished for half a lifetime. Is it wearing out? Is it getting softer, better?"

**Why It Works:**
- Imperative opening: "Stop and think"
- Synesthesia: "dark pocket" (visual + spatial)
- "Lovingly used and punished" (contradiction that's true)
- Rhetorical questions build engagement
- Assumes shared experience with baseball

---

#### 4. WOMEN'S TUXEDO SHIRT
"The question, really, is how did you get by this long without it? No wonder you've been a little sulky; I know I'm not the only one who's noticed it."

**Why It Works:**
- Begins with question (inverts typical structure)
- Second sentence is playful accusation
- Intimate tone—"I know I'm not the only one"
- Wry humor without meanness
- Creates narrative: you needed this, didn't realize it

---

#### 5. WWII CANADIAN AIR FORCE DUFFELBAG
"A farmer's son, growing up in Alberta, Canada, sees a lot of sky. It sets him dreaming.

At 16 he's flying a crop duster.
At 23 he's an RCAF volunteer in the Battle of Britain. Bader's 242 Squadron. A Hawker Hurricane of his own.

Scrambling twice a day to intercept German ME 109s soon convinces him that he is not, in fact, immortal. But there are compensations.

At the pub in Duxford, the wings on his uniform have a persuasive effect on the local solicitor's daughter. (Other envious soldiers are now referring to fighter pilots as 'The Brylcreem Boys.')"

**Why It Works:**
- Entire short story in miniature
- Character development through action
- Historical specificity (Bader, 242 Squadron, ME 109s)
- Dry humor: "not, in fact, immortal"
- Parenthetical aside adds authentic detail
- Product barely mentioned—bag is vessel for this story

---

#### 6. MEPHISTO WALKING SHOE
"Weeding my way through the jungle of 'biomechanically perfect' and 'orthopedically engineered' and 'air-injected' running-jumping-springing-catapulting shoes out there, I believe I have found the ultimate walking shoe. (Walking, after all, is what most of us do most of the time.)"

**Why It Works:**
- Mocks competitor language without naming them
- Compound adjectives satirize marketing-speak
- Parenthetical common sense: "what most of us do"
- "I believe" = humble authority
- Positions product against noise

---

#### 7. JERMYN STREET BADGER BRUSH
"Jermyn St., and nearby Old Bond St., are exactly what you (if you were an Englishman) might dream about, if you unexpectedly found yourself pinned beneath an avalanche of boulders at the bottom of the Min Gorge in China.

Waiting to be rescued, your mind might turn to the cool hushed perfection of all the tiny elegant shops along certain London streets, shops where clerks read your mind, anticipate your wishes, bringing forth soothing potions, perfectly fitted shoes, impeccable linen suits, cartridge belts, shooting gloves, rare oriental carpets, cucumber sandwiches, leather-bound first editions, coin-silver snuffboxes...

Dreaming of these things, no doubt, has kept many an Englishman sane."

**Why It Works:**
- Absurdist hypothetical opening
- Specificity: "Min Gorge in China"
- Catalog of English perfection
- Ellipsis creates dream-state
- Dry punchline: "kept many an Englishman sane"
- Product (brush) emerges from this world

---

#### 8. E. DIGBY BALTZELL MEMORIAL TWEEDS
"'You must meet the WASP man,' hostesses would say. A dashing figure at the Germantown Cricket Club, around the quad at Penn. Invariably wore candy-striped shirts and bow ties with his tweeds, although he'd defend, in principle, your right to do otherwise."

**Why It Works:**
- Begins with dialogue (immediate scene)
- Proper nouns anchor reality (Germantown Cricket Club, Penn)
- "Invariably" = habit, character detail
- Final clause shows character through contradiction
- Tribute that doubles as description

---

### B. SCENE-SETTING & ATMOSPHERE

#### 9. BANANA BOAT TO COSTA RICA
"It was late afternoon when I got to the Asseburg, a break-bulk freighter of German registry. Black hull, white superstructure, about 550 feet long, with the cabin and stack amidships. She had a crew of 24—12 officers and 12 hands.

I stayed in the owner's cabin on the Asseburg. It was next to the captain's cabin, and adjacent to the officers' mess. I had a living room with a sofa, coffee table, bar, and a writing desk under the porthole, a comfortable bedroom with two beds, night tables, and a dresser, plus a small, efficient bath. The ship had been built in Europe, probably in the 1950s, and everything was well made by skilled craftsmen; you couldn't slip a cigarette paper into the seams where mahogany met steel.

This was a real owner's cabin, this was a real working freighter, these were real seafaring men."

**Why It Works:**
- Specific vessel name, registry, dimensions
- Technical language (amidships, break-bulk)
- Room-by-room inventory creates immersion
- Craftsmanship detail: "cigarette paper" test
- Triple anaphora: "real...real...real" (emphasis through repetition)

---

#### 10. BANANA BOAT SUNSET
"I would sit outside on deck with a drink and watch the sun go down. The weather was warm—not too hot, not too cold, not cloudy; there was a breeze. The briny smell was right, the breeze was right, the sun setting over the ocean was right. Everything was in sync, and it couldn't have gotten any better.

You can always tell how good the helmsman is by how straight the wake is. This one you could see stretching straight back for miles."

**Why It Works:**
- Goldilocks repetition: "not too hot, not too cold"
- Anaphora: "was right...was right...was right"
- Simple perfection: "couldn't have gotten any better"
- Single detail proves larger truth: straight wake = good helmsman

---

#### 11. CAVALRY CHARGE FANTASY
"You line up a hundred horsemen in a straight line. Guns, sabers, flags. Nervous horses, pawing the ground, jigging in place, flared nostrils, ears straight up, 1,300 pounds of muscle just as anxious as you are.

It's the middle of August. The ground is hard and dry. Any movement causes dust. One hundred horses cause a lot of dust. It's 7:30 in the morning, but it's already hot and humid, as the South is in August. There's a faint smell of honeysuckle, mixed with the smell of horses and leather. Some of the horses are lathered up because they're nervous; that makes their smell even more intense. You check that your gun and your saber are where you want them. Your feet are where you want them in the stirrups. The reins are firmly in hand, and now let's get on with it. At the signal, the line moves forward, first at the walk, all in unison. Then the order to trot, still in the straight line. Then the canter, a ragged straight line like a storm front breaking. The bugler blows charge, you go into a dead run, the straight line disappears, it's the fastest horses out front now, a rush of fear and exhilaration and no stopping until you engage the enemy. There's no time to review your life or pray—that should have been done earlier."

**Why It Works:**
- Second person puts reader IN the charge
- Present tense = immediate
- Fragment sentences: "Guns, sabers, flags"
- Sensory cascade: smell of honeysuckle, horses, leather
- Precise details: "1,300 pounds," "7:30 in the morning"
- Momentum builds through sentence rhythm
- Dark humor in final line

---

### C. DIRECT ADDRESS & PERSONALITY

#### 12. ITALIAN BLAZER (Career Advice)
"A lucky man starts out doing what he loves. He does it well enough to prosper. Eventually, though, he finds that what he loves has become just a small part of what he has to do. He accumulates dark suits... starts getting testy.

Are you at (or nearing) this danger point? I'd suggest making this sporty Italian blazer part of your life. Wearing it feels like opening all the windows in a corner office and letting the papers blow off the desk. Encourages you to get out on the links more often, spend a month around Lake Como, think about what really matters: delegation, and Where We Want to Be Five Years from Now."

**Why It Works:**
- Universal midlife/career arc
- "Dark suits" and "testy" = economical character sketch
- Question creates self-assessment moment
- Blazer as liberation tool
- Gently mocks corporate-speak: "Where We Want to Be Five Years from Now"
- Specific fantasy: "Lake Como"

---

#### 13. COMPANY PHILOSOPHY STATEMENT
"Clearly, people want things that make their lives the way they wish they were."

**Why It Works:**
- One sentence manifesto
- No qualifier, no hedge
- "Clearly" = assume reader already knows this
- "The way they wish they were" = aspiration over reality
- Explains entire business model

---

#### 14. ON IMPULSIVENESS
"I wasn't scheduled to be in Jackson Hole. The truth was, I'd been in Denver on business, found myself bored and restless, and decided on impulse to go to Wyoming. I'd never been to any of those western ski resort towns, and I was curious. Impulsive actions like that—going to Jackson Hole when I was supposed to be heading someplace else—aren't out of character for me. I've always been impulsive. It's how I'm wired."

**Why It Works:**
- Confession creates intimacy
- "The truth was" = honesty signal
- "It's how I'm wired" = acceptance of self
- Sets up: spontaneity leads to discovery (the duster)

---

### D. CULTURAL REFERENCE & ERUDITION

#### 15. CHURCHILL'S SILVERWARE
"We sold items like the silverware from the House of Commons—the very same knives, forks, and spoons that Churchill, Chamberlain, and Macmillan ate with."

**Why It Works:**
- Historical figures, not "famous people"
- "The very same" = authenticity claim
- No explanation needed—assumes reader knows who these are

---

#### 16. REFERENCES IN OWNER'S MANUAL
"The Owner's Manual was filled with references to Alexander the Great, the Russian Navy, Kanchanaburi, Tolstoi and Vita Sackville-West, Ludwig Wittgenstein and chaos theory, Georgia O'Keeffe, Bear Bryant, Gable and Harlow, and Wendy Hiller, some of them pretty obscure."

**Why It Works:**
- Eclectic mix: high and low culture
- Bear Bryant next to Wittgenstein
- "Some of them pretty obscure" = self-aware
- Assumes readers will recognize most, look up rest

---

### E. HUMOR & WIT

#### 17. HOLY CROSS DINING HALL
"You said grace first, then dug into the wholesome but monotonous food—a perpetual cycle of pot roast, spaghetti, ham, chicken, pork chops, and fish on Fridays. I remember lots of potatoes, and some very gluey scallops."

**Why It Works:**
- "Wholesome but monotonous" = precise
- Menu list creates rhythm of sameness
- "Very gluey scallops" = specific, visual, funny

---

#### 18. MORGAN ROADSTER AT BLAKES
"The manager's brother owns a Morgan, though, and the manager is contacting him to see if it's available now."

[After brother is out of country:]

"We never did get the car. But the effort that went into trying to fulfill my request was remarkable. Most hotels would have made a few calls and abandoned the search. Not Blakes."

**Why It Works:**
- Failure as success story
- Values effort over outcome
- "Not Blakes" = simple, strong ending
- Models customer service philosophy

---

#### 19. MANURE BOOTS RETURN
"Audrey marched into my office with a small army of customer-service reps, holding a pair of boots at arm's length. A customer had worn them out doing farm work, and he felt they should have lasted longer. He'd mailed them back to us for replacement, still covered with cow manure."

[After deliberation:]

"'We either have absolute satisfaction or we don't,' I said. 'Ninety-nine-point-nine percent of our customers are honest. This man probably does feel the boots didn't hold up. If we send him another pair, he'll tell his friends about our great service. They'll become customers, too. That's the kind of company we want to be. That's the kind we're going to be.'

We sent him new boots for free."

**Why It Works:**
- Absurd image: boots "at arm's length," "cow manure"
- Tests stated value: "Absolute Satisfaction. Period."
- Decision explained through logic, not emotion
- Final line: simple, decisive

---

### F. SENSORY DETAIL

#### 20. GERMAN BEER WITH CAPTAIN KALISH
"We drank German beer long into the night and told stories. The captain had many more stories than I did at that point. I thought myself quite worldly then, but I really hadn't been anywhere."

**Why It Works:**
- "Long into the night" = duration as atmosphere
- Self-deprecation: "I really hadn't been anywhere"
- Implies: this is where real worldliness begins

---

#### 21. BRASS SHOP IN INDIA
"I recall one early visit to a small shop filled with gleaming navigational equipment, compasses, telescopes; there was a tang of brass in the air that made your mouth water."

**Why It Works:**
- Synesthesia: "tang of brass...made your mouth water"
- Specific catalog: "compasses, telescopes"
- Semicolon for proper pacing

---

#### 22. LONDON TAXIS & THE KNOWLEDGE
"We did most of our getting about in those black London taxis built roomy enough to accommodate a gent in a top hat. The drivers always knew exactly where we were going; to qualify for a license, they spend at least two years traveling around the city on motorbikes acquiring 'The Knowledge'—memorizing over 16,000 streets, landmarks, stores, restaurants, and other destinations in a 113-square-mile area. (Curious fact: The part of the human brain dedicated to spatial relationships grows significantly larger in London cabbies.)"

**Why It Works:**
- Specific detail: "gent in a top hat" (not just "spacious")
- Explains "The Knowledge"—expertise creates trust
- Neuroscience fact in parenthetical = bonus intel
- Shows: everything well-made has a story

---

### G. PRODUCT AS CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT

#### 23. UNSNAPPING THE DUSTER
"I was wandering around, window shopping, and I stopped when I caught sight of my reflection. I was disappointed at what I saw. I had bought the coat because it was long; it went all the way to the ground. I thought, 'Why did I buy this if I was going to snap it up to look like something it isn't?' I unsnapped it, and felt like I was at last my own person. I was different, and I didn't care. In fact, I liked it."

**Why It Works:**
- Moment of self-recognition
- Product as permission to be authentic
- "At last my own person" = identity transformation
- "I didn't care. In fact, I liked it." = progression from defiance to joy

---

#### 24. THE DUSTER IN ATLANTA AIRPORT
"Once, when I was at the Atlanta airport, in from San Francisco, trying to catch the last plane home to Lexington, Kentucky, I was almost pulled down by a guy who grabbed my coattails as I ran by. He was in his late 40s, built like an ex-linebacker who'd kept on eating and drinking the way he had in his playing days. Business suit, wrinkled white shirt, loosened necktie. As I spun around, I could see a couple of miniature Jack Daniels in his shirt pocket. 'Grrreat coat,' he slurred, weaving into my face, both of us off balance. 'Where I can get one a' them?'"

**Why It Works:**
- Entire character sketch in physical details
- "Kept on eating and drinking the way he had" = economy
- "Miniature Jack Daniels" = specific, visual
- Phonetic dialogue: "Grrreat," "a' them"
- Drunk guy's urgency = product magnetism

---

### H. BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY IN NARRATIVE

#### 25. ON FOCUS GROUPS
"Ordinarily, companies do extensive testing of products before they screw up the courage to put them into stores. They're very fond of focus groups, where consumers led by a moderator give their reactions to new-product concepts while researchers and ad-agency people watch from behind a one-way mirror. The process can be helpful if you frame questions right and look at the results in an enlightened way, without taking them as dictation. Often, though, it elicits enough negative opinions for fearful managers to smother good ideas in the cradle. It encourages compromises that appeal to the lowest common denominator."

**Why It Works:**
- "Screw up the courage" = ironic (should be opposite)
- One-way mirror = surveillance metaphor
- "Without taking them as dictation" = precise warning
- "Smother good ideas in the cradle" = vivid image
- Explains entire anti-committee philosophy

---

#### 26. VENTURE CAPITALIST ON "KOOKY PROFESSORS"
"'There aren't enough kooky college professors out there to buy your stuff,' a venture capitalist once told me. What really troubled the fellow was that here were things that didn't happen to appeal to him, personally, and we couldn't point to a mountain of market research that 'proved' they'd be welcomed by anybody else, either."

**Why It Works:**
- Direct quote for authenticity
- "Kooky college professors" = reveals VC's thinking
- "Troubled the fellow" = restrained disdain
- Scare quotes on "proved"
- Implies: we succeeded anyway

---

### I. CRAFTSMANSHIP & DETAIL

#### 27. FATHER O'HARA'S GALILEO LESSON
"Although Galileo was still condemned by the Church at that point, the good Jesuit fathers had no problem with explaining how he had set up the basis of modern science—you make a hypothesis, design an experiment to test it, and then see if the results bear you out. For 1,800 years, everybody had blindly accepted Aristotle's common-sense view that heavy things fall faster than light ones. Then Galileo dropped two different weights off the Leaning Tower of Pisa at the same time and found, as he'd expected, that the heavy one and the light one hit the ground simultaneously. Good-bye, Aristotle. I liked that."

**Why It Works:**
- Historical context: "still condemned by the Church"
- Scientific method explained cleanly
- "1,800 years" = scale of overturned belief
- "Good-bye, Aristotle. I liked that." = Peterman's values revealed
- Foreshadows: he'll challenge conventional wisdom too

#### 28. NROTC OFFICER & THE POTATOES
"The commanding officer was sitting ramrod straight in his chair and looking at me with disapproval. He had a gruff, jowly military presence, like Sterling Hayden in Doctor Strangelove, and he inclined his head as he looked at me, making it seem as if he were looking down at me even though we were at eye level with each other. 'I haven't heard that you're that good,' he said, shaking his head. 'And even if you get as far as the minors, you'll never make any money. You know, in the minors, they pay you with a sack of potatoes.'

I remember thinking, 'This guy is a real old timer. Potatoes?' but not saying anything."

**Why It Works:**
- Physical description reveals character
- Sterling Hayden reference = visual shorthand
- "Pay you with a sack of potatoes" = absurd, dated
- Internal thought: "Potatoes?" = generational gap
- Sets up: young man rejecting authority for dream

---

### J. ENDINGS & PRICE REVEALS

#### 29. SHIRT AS PEDESTAL
"A shirt is the pedestal upon which a human face stands to present its case."

**Why It Works:**
- Aphorism = quotable
- Metaphor: face as artwork, shirt as gallery
- Elevates mundane to essential
- Could stand alone as philosophy

---

#### 30. ABSOLUTE SATISFACTION
"The Owner's Manual had a simple guarantee printed on the inside cover: 'Absolute Satisfaction. Period.'"

**Why It Works:**
- Two words: "Absolute" and "Period"
- No fine print
- "Period" = non-negotiable
- Reflects entire company ethos

---

## 4. DO / DON'T GUIDE

### ✅ DO:

1. **Write in Second Person for Immersion**
   - "You line up a hundred horsemen"
   - "You check that your gun and your saber are where you want them"
   - Makes reader protagonist of story

2. **Begin With Story, Never Product**
   - Product emerges naturally from narrative
   - Story creates context, context creates desire
   - Never: "Introducing our new..."

3. **Use Specific, Concrete Details**
   - "Pearl buttons 1/8" thick, leather seams with 14 stitches per inch"
   - Not: "high-quality construction"
   - Specificity = authority = trust

4. **Employ Historical/Cultural References Naturally**
   - Assume intelligent reader
   - No explaining unless necessary
   - Reference to create world, not to show off

5. **Write Scenes, Not Descriptions**
   - "It's 7:30 in the morning, but it's already hot and humid"
   - Not: "This product is perfect for summer"
   - Show weather, don't describe season

6. **Mix Sentence Lengths Dramatically**
   - "They are old. They are useless. But they are beautiful."
   - Follow with longer flowing sentence
   - Creates rhythm, emphasis, readability

7. **Use Product as Character Development Tool**
   - "I unsnapped it, and felt like I was at last my own person"
   - Product = permission to be authentic self
   - Transformation, not transaction

8. **Be Honest About Limitations**
   - "They also remind me of more recent things, which (amazingly) we've given up"
   - Admit imperfection, nostalgia, loss
   - Honesty within romance = trust

9. **Place Price and Sizing at End**
   - Never lead with it
   - Earn the sale first through story
   - Format: "Price, $35. Sizes 7-1/2 to 8-3/4."

10. **Use Parenthetical Asides for Personality**
    - "(Walking, after all, is what most of us do most of the time.)"
    - "(Other envious soldiers are now referring to fighter pilots as 'The Brylcreem Boys.')"
    - Adds intimacy, humor, insider knowledge

11. **Employ Rhetorical Questions Sparingly**
    - "The question, really, is how did you get by this long without it?"
    - "Isn't it time to take some kind of stand here?"
    - Create engagement, not annoyance

12. **Trust Reader Intelligence**
    - Reference Vita Sackville-West without explanation
    - Assume worldliness
    - Don't talk down

13. **Write Compressed Stories**
    - Entire novel in paragraph (Canadian airman)
    - Beginning, middle, end
    - Character development through action

14. **Use Sensory Language**
    - "Tang of brass in the air that made your mouth water"
    - Touch, smell, sound, taste, sight
    - Physical details = immersion

15. **Create Lists for Rhythm**
    - "Peaches worth eating and doctors who make housecalls. Real starch in shirt collars. Bakelite. Books sewn in signatures..."
    - Varied length items
    - Builds cumulative power

---

1. **Never Use Exclamation Points** (except extremely rare emphasis)
   - Not: "This coat is amazing!"

2. **Never Use Marketing Jargon**
   - Not: "game-changing," "must-have," "revolutionary"
   - Not: "perfect for the modern man"
   - Not: "elevate your style"

3. **Never Compare to Competitors**
   - Not: "Unlike other brands..."
   - Mock generic category without naming names
   - "Biomechanically perfect" and "orthopedically engineered" shoes = satire of category

4. **Never Use Bullet Points**
   - Everything in prose
   - Features woven into narrative
   - Lists written as sentences with commas

5. **Never Lead With Product Name or Announcement**
   - Not: "Introducing the J. Peterman Duster"
   - Not: "Our new shirt collection"
   - Story first, always

6. **Never Use Superlatives Without Evidence**
   - Not: "the best coat ever made"
   - Yes: "pearl buttons 1/8" thick" (prove quality)

7. **Never Pressure or Create False Urgency**
   - Not: "Limited time only!"
   - Not: "Order now before they're gone!"
   - Trust that story creates desire

8. **Never Use Testimonials**
   - No customer quotes
   - No "As seen in..." except organic (Tom Peters wrote about us)
   - Authority through voice, not borrowed credibility

9. **Never Explain the Metaphor**
   - "A shirt is the pedestal upon which a human face stands to present its case"
   - Don't add: "meaning your shirt is important"
   - Trust reader to get it

10. **Never Write in Corporate/Formal Voice**
    - Not: "We are pleased to announce..."
    - Not: "Our company is committed to..."
    - Conversational, personal, human

11. **Never Use Trend Language**
    - Not: "on-trend," "fashion-forward"
    - Not current year fashion terms
    - Timeless over trendy

12. **Never Oversell**
    - Not: "You need this coat!"
    - Not: "This will change your life!"
    - Understatement more powerful

13. **Never Use Lorem Ipsum Beauty Language**
    - Not: "embrace your journey"
    - Not: "celebrate your authentic self"
    - Not: "luxury redefined"
    - Concrete over abstract

14. **Never Put Product Features First**
    - Not: "Made from 100% cotton..."
    - Weave into story: "The shirt had been made in Ecuador"

15. **Never Use All Caps, Bold, or Typography Tricks**
    - No EMPHASIS through formatting
    - Emphasis through sentence structure only
    - Clean, readable type

---

### ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:

1. **Explaining Too Much**
   - Trust intelligence
   - Reference without footnote
   - Let gaps create curiosity

2. **Forgetting the "You"**
   - Keep reader in second person when possible
   - "You line up" not "One lines up"
   - Immersion over observation

3. **Making Product the Hero**
   - Product is tool for transformation
   - Reader is hero, product is means
   - Identity > object

4. **Losing the Plot**
   - Every piece needs narrative spine
   - Beginning, middle, end
   - Product placement within structure

5. **Sounding Like Everyone Else**
   - Read it aloud
   - Does it sound like Peterman or like catalog copy?
   - If it sounds like marketing, rewrite

6. **Over-Romanticizing Without Foundation**
   - Romance built on real details
   - "Pearl buttons 1/8" thick" before "beautiful"
   - Fact > feeling > fact again

7. **Forgetting to Close**
   - Don't just trail off
   - End with image, price, or call
   - Ellipsis okay, but purposeful

8. **Using Too Many Adjectives**
   - Not: "beautiful, elegant, sophisticated"
   - Choose one strong image instead
   - Nouns and verbs carry weight

---

## 5. STYLE RULES

### Sentence Structure

**Average Length:** 12-18 words
**Range:** 3 words to 40+ words
**Variation Strategy:** High contrast

**Patterns:**

1. **Short Declarative for Emphasis**
   - "They are old. They are useless. But they are beautiful."
   - Three beats, then turn
   - Period creates pause, weight

2. **Medium Flowing for Narrative**
   - "I would sit outside on deck with a drink and watch the sun go down."
   - Compound actions, natural rhythm
   - Reads at speaking pace

3. **Long Immersive for Scene-Building**
   - "There's a faint smell of honeysuckle, mixed with the smell of horses and leather, some of the horses are lathered up because they're nervous, that makes their smell even more intense."
   - Accumulation creates atmosphere
   - Commas cascade details

4. **Fragment for Inventory/List**
   - "Guns, sabers, flags."
   - No verb needed
   - Staccato rhythm

**Conjunctions:**
- "And" to begin sentences (creates continuity)
- "But" for emphasis
- Semicolon for related thoughts
- Em dash for aside
- Parentheses for bonus info

---

### Paragraph Rhythm

**Typical Length:** 3-6 sentences
**Never:** Single-sentence paragraphs unless massive emphasis

**Opening Sentence:**
- Scene-setter: "It's 7:30 in the morning"

- Statement: "They are old. They are useless."
- Direct address: "Stop and think about..."

**Development:**
- Add detail
- Build context
- Deepen story
- Move toward product

**Closing Sentence:**
- Image that lingers
- Product entry
- Price reveal
- Elliptical trail-off

**White Space:**
- Paragraph break = beat
- Longer copy = more breaks
- Never wall of text

---

### Punctuation Signature

**Period:**
- Heavy use for short sentences
- Creates weight, pause
- "Period." as final word

**Comma:**
- Generous but not excessive
- Separates list items: "Guns, sabers, flags"
- Sets off parenthetical: "although, in principle"

**Semicolon:**
- Two related complete thoughts
- More formal than comma
- "There's a tang of brass in the air; it made your mouth water"

**Em Dash:**
- Interruption or aside: "—the very same knives"
- Emphasis before finish: "—not to sell, but as a reminder"
- Can replace colon

**Parentheses:**
- Bonus information
- Humor
- Aside to reader
- Never essential info

**Ellipsis:**
- Trail off: "dark suits..."
- List continuation: "cucumber sandwiches, leather-bound first editions..."
- Never for suspense or drama

**Quotation Marks:**
- Dialogue
- Scare quotes rare: "proved"
- Never for emphasis

**Exclamation Point:**
- Avoid 99% of time
- Only in quoted dialogue if character would use
- Never in narrative voice

---

### Tone Modulation

**Base Tone:** Conversational friend
**Range:** Wry humor to romantic to matter-of-fact

**Techniques:**

1. **Humor Through Understatement**
   - "I remember thinking, 'This guy is a real old timer. Potatoes?'"
   - Not laughing AT, laughing WITH

2. **Romance Through Specificity**
   - Not: "beautiful sunset"
   - Yes: "the sun setting over the ocean was right"

3. **Authority Through Experience**
   - "The captain had many more stories than I did at that point"
   - Admits limits while claiming experience

4. **Intimacy Through Confession**
   - "I've always been impulsive. It's how I'm wired."
   - Vulnerability = connection

**Shifts:**
- Can move from epic (cavalry charge) to domestic (office) within same piece
- Tone shifts signal paragraph breaks
- Never jarring—always motivated

- [ ] No exclamation points
- [ ] Price/sizing at end
- [ ] Reads aloud naturally

---

## FINAL NOTES

The Peterman technique is **storytelling for commerce** without feeling commercial. Every technique serves trust-building through entertainment and education. The product is always the means to a desired identity, never just an object.

Master the techniques individually, then combine naturally. The best Peterman copy uses 3-4 techniques per piece, seamlessly integrated.

**The Test:** Read it aloud. Does it sound like a friend telling you a story, or a company trying to sell you something?

If it sounds like the latter, rewrite.
