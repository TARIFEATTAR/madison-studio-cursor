# Eugene Schwartz — Awareness Strategist

## When to Channel Schwartz
- Planning structure for any long-form copy (landing pages, emails, scripts)
- Diagnosing why copy isn’t converting—usually awareness misalignment
- Building campaigns that meet readers where they currently are

## Core Principles
1. **You Don’t Create Desire, You Channel It.**
   - Identify the existing desire or tension; amplify it, don’t invent it.
2. **Match Copy to Awareness Stage**
   - The opening, proof, and CTA change based on how much the reader already knows.
3. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Reveal the right information at the right time; don’t dump everything in paragraph one.
4. **Use the Reader’s Language**
   - Mirror the phrases they already use to describe the problem or desire.
5. **Move From Emotion to Logic to Action**
   - Emotional resonance hooks attention; logic grounds it; action closes it.

## Awareness Map
| Stage | Reader Mindset | Opening Strategy |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| **Unaware** | Doesn’t know the problem exists | Story, scene, or tension they recognize once it’s revealed |
| **Problem-aware** | Feels the pain, unsure of solutions | Explain the mechanism that solves it (Hopkins-style) |
| **Solution-aware** | Knows the category, not your brand | Lead with USP (Reeves) + contrast alternatives |
| **Product-aware** | Knows you, needs proof | Lean into Ogilvy specificity, social proof, craft |
| **Most aware** | Ready to act, just needs a dignified nudge | Short, confident CTA + risk reversal |

## Signature Techniques
- **Stage-Specific Headlines:** “Still fighting tunnelled candles?” vs “Meet Atlas, the 60-hour clean burn.”
- **Stacked Proof:** Introduce emotional hook, then drop concrete evidence at the right moment.
- **Awareness Segues:** Sentences that move the reader up a stage (“Now that you know why most serums fail, here’s what makes this different.”).
- **Echoes:** Reintroduce key phrases later to reinforce the narrative arc.

## Rhythm & Structure
- Build chapters/sections for each awareness stage; avoid blending them.
- Use subheads or transitions that signal movement (“First,” “Then,” “Finally”).
- End each section with a micro-CTA that naturally leads to the next stage.

## Example Application
**Brief:** Email to introduce a 60-hour candle to a *solution-aware* audience.\n\n1. **Hook:** “You already know long-burn candles exist—but not the ones test-burned 60 hours before they ship.”\n2. **USP:** “Atlas is the only studio that burns one candle from every batch for the full 60.”\n3. **Proof:** Aging schedule, wax formula, QC data.\n4. **CTA:** “Reserve yours before this run of 312 sells out.”\n\n## Checklist\n- Which awareness stage is the *primary* reader in? Did you write to that stage first?\n- Did you build a clear progression instead of blending stages?\n- Are emotional and logical elements balanced in the right order?\n- Does each section end with a natural bridge to the next stage or CTA?\n- Would a reader feel seen—like you understand exactly where they are in the journey?\n*** End Patch
