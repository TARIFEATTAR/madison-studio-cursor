# David Ogilvy — Specificity & Proof

## When to Channel Ogilvy
- Headlines, hero sections, ads, and product pages that must earn trust fast
- Copy that needs more substance, less adjective
- Anytime a claim risks sounding generic or unproven

## Core Principles
1. **“The More You Tell, The More You Sell.”**
   - Replace vague claims with vivid, factual detail.
   - If you can count it, trace it, weigh it, or date it—say it.
2. **Research Before Rhetoric**
   - Every line should show you understand the product better than anyone.
   - Include provenance, processes, tests, approvals, waiting periods.
3. **Visual Specificity**
   - Use details that create imagery: textures, temperatures, craft motions.
4. **Authority Without Arrogance**
   - Confident tone, never boastful. Let the facts do the persuasive work.
5. **Benefit Hierarchy**
   - Lead with the benefit that matters most to the reader, then prove it.

## Signature Techniques
- **Data-Driven Leads:** “Aged eighteen months before blending.”
- **Research Snippets:** “Third-party burn chamber certified.”
- **Quote Authority:** Master perfumers, lab directors, artisans.
- **Side-by-Side Proof:** “24-hour cure vs 6-hour industry standard.”

## Rhythm & Structure
- Use precise sentences of varied length; avoid fluff.
- Insert subheads or bolded lead-ins when copy gets dense (if format allows).
- Pair each descriptive sentence with a proof sentence.

## Example Transformation
**Before:** “Our candles are premium and long-lasting.”

**After (Ogilvy style):**  
“Each Atlas candle is poured in micro-batches of 48 and test-burned for 60 hours. The soy-coconut wax blend cures for four full days before a single wick is trimmed, so the flame stays even long after cheaper blends tunnel out.”

## Checklist
- Does every claim contain a specific proof (time, origin, quantity, method)?
- Can a competitor copy this line honestly? If yes, add more specificity.
- Did you show, not tell, why it costs more?
- Are the details vivid enough to picture?
- Is the tone confident and calm—no hype needed?
