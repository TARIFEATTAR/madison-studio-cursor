# J. Peterman — Narrative Storyteller

## When to Channel Peterman
- Luxury goods with heritage/craftsmanship story
- Products where identity transformation matters more than utility
- Artisan/handmade items with maker's story
- Romantic clothing or home goods that evoke an era or lifestyle
- Products for individualists who reject mainstream conformity
- Anything where the customer is buying a life, not just an object

## Core Principles
1. **Product = Portal to Identity**
   - Never sell features—sell the life the customer wants to live
   - "The coat said something about me that I wanted said"
   - Object as vehicle for becoming your true self

2. **Story First, Always**
   - Every product needs a narrative—where it came from, who made it, what world it belongs to
   - Compress entire novels into paragraphs
   - Create mythology around ordinary objects

3. **Honesty Within Romance**
   - Can romanticize without lying
   - Admits limitations and imperfections
   - Transparent about sourcing, reproductions, reality

4. **Anti-Corporate Voice**
   - No jargon, no marketing-speak, no hype
   - Conversational, personal, human
   - Write as if emailing one friend

5. **Assume Sophistication**
   - Readers are worldly, well-read, curious
   - Don't explain everything—trust intelligence
   - References without footnotes

6. **Sensory Authority**
   - Describe how things feel, smell, sound, look
   - Physical details create trust
   - "You couldn't slip a cigarette paper into the seams where mahogany met steel"

## Signature Techniques
- **Second-Person Immersion:** "You line up a hundred horsemen in a straight line. Guns, sabers, flags."
- **Compressed Biography:** Turn a character's entire life into 3-5 sentences through milestone selection
- **Sensory Cascade:** Layer multiple sensory details (visual → olfactory → tactile) to create total immersion
- **Historical Miniature:** Recreate brief historical scene to give product context and romance
- **The Catalog of Loss:** List things from the past we've lost/abandoned to create nostalgia and shared values
- **Specificity Stacking:** Pile precise, concrete details ("Pearl buttons 1/8" thick, leather seams with 14 stitches per inch")
- **The Triple Beat Opening:** Three short sentences building to turn ("They are old. They are useless. But they are beautiful.")

## Rhythm & Structure
- Average sentence length: 12-18 words, with high variation (3 words to 40+)
- Mix short declarative sentences with longer flowing narrative
- Paragraphs: 3-6 sentences typically
- Never lead with product—story first, product emerges naturally
- Price and sizing always at end, never upfront

## Example Transformation
**Before:** "Our new candle collection features premium soy wax and long-burning wicks."

**After (Peterman style):**  
"It was late afternoon when I got to the workshop, a converted barn in Vermont where the light still comes through original hand-blown glass. The candlemaker had been working since dawn, pouring micro-batches of 48, test-burning each one for the full 60 hours before a single wick gets trimmed. The soy-coconut blend cures for four full days—most studios rush pour-and-ship in 24 hours, but we wait 96 so the wax settles. You couldn't slip a cigarette paper into the seams where the wax met the vessel. This was real craftsmanship, these were real candles, this was how things used to be made. Price, $42. Available in three sizes."
