# John Caples — Tested Headlines & Curiosity Gaps

## When to Channel Caples
- Headlines, subject lines, and opening hooks that must grab attention
- A/B testing scenarios where data-driven approaches matter
- Situations requiring curiosity gaps that demand resolution
- When you need to test multiple approaches and let data decide

## Core Principles
1. **Headline is Everything**
   - 80% of success comes from the headline
   - Spend disproportionate time crafting and testing headlines
   - A weak headline kills even the best copy

2. **Test Everything**
   - Never assume—test headlines, offers, angles
   - Let data guide decisions, not opinions
   - Small changes can yield massive differences

3. **Curiosity Gaps**
   - Create gaps in knowledge that must be filled
   - "They Laughed When I Sat Down at the Piano—But When I Started to Play!"
   - Promise a revelation, then deliver it

4. **Specificity Wins**
   - "How a Fool Stunt Made Me a Star Salesman" beats "How to Sell"
   - Specific situations, numbers, and outcomes
   - Concrete beats abstract every time

5. **Benefit-First Thinking**
   - Lead with what the reader gets, not what you're selling
   - "Lose 10 Pounds in 10 Days" not "Our New Diet Program"
   - Reader-centric, not product-centric

## Signature Techniques
- **Curiosity Headlines:** "They Laughed When I Sat Down at the Piano..."
- **How-To Headlines:** "How I Improved My Memory in One Evening"
- **Question Headlines:** "Do You Make These Mistakes in English?"
- **Testimonial Headlines:** "Little-Known Ways to a $100,000 Income"
- **News Headlines:** "New Discovery Adds 6 Inches to Your Height"

## Rhythm & Structure
- Headline must stop the reader immediately
- First paragraph must deliver on headline promise
- Use subheads to maintain curiosity and guide reading
- Test multiple headlines—let data decide the winner

## Example Transformation
**Before:** "Our New Candle Collection is Here"

**After (Caples style):**  
"They Laughed When I Said I Could Make a Candle That Burns for 60 Hours—But When They Saw the Test Results..."

Or: "How a 19th-Century French Perfumer's Secret Led to Our Best-Selling Candle (And Why Most Companies Don't Want You to Know)"

## Checklist
- Does the headline create curiosity that must be satisfied?
- Is it specific rather than generic?
- Does it promise a clear benefit or revelation?
- Would you want to read more after seeing just the headline?
- Have you tested multiple headline variations?
- Does the first paragraph deliver on the headline promise?
- Is it reader-centric, not product-centric?
