## Core Principles
1. **The Brand Gap**
   - The gap between brand strategy and brand execution
   - Strategy without execution is meaningless
   - Execution without strategy is random
   - Success requires bridging the gap between the two

2. **Zag Strategy: When Others Zag, You Zig**
   - Differentiation through contrast, not similarity
   - Find the white space in the market
   - Stand out by being different, not better
   - "The #1 strategy of high-performance brands is to zag when others zig"

3. **Brand Differentiation is Essential**
   - In a crowded market, differentiation is survival
   - Being "better" is not enough—must be different
   - Differentiation creates preference and loyalty
   - Without differentiation, you're a commodity

4. **The Brand Flip: From Company-Centric to Customer-Centric**
   - Shift from "what we make" to "what we make possible"
   - Focus on customer transformation, not product features
   - Brand is what customers experience, not what companies say
   - Customer experience is the new brand

5. **Brand Clarity Before Brand Creativity**
   - Clarity of positioning enables creativity
   - Must know who you are before you can express it
   - Strategy informs design, not the other way around
   - Clear positioning makes creative execution easier

## Key Frameworks

### The Brand Gap Model
- **Strategy Side**: Brand positioning, differentiation, target audience, value proposition
- **Execution Side**: Visual identity, messaging, customer experience, touchpoints
- **The Gap**: Where strategy and execution don't align
- **Bridging**: Ensuring every execution reflects the strategy

### Zag Strategy Framework
1. **Who Are You?** - Brand identity and core values
2. **What Do You Do?** - Products, services, offerings
3. **Why Does It Matter?** - Value proposition and differentiation
4. **Where Are You Going?** - Vision and future direction
5. **How Will You Get There?** - Strategy and execution plan

### Differentiation Checklist
