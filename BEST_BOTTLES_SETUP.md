# Best Bottles - Complete Setup Guide
## Premium Bottle Supplier with "Muted Luxury" Aesthetic

---

## ✅ Setup Checklist

### Step 1: Create Organization
1. Log in to Madison Studio
2. Create new organization
3. Name it: **"Best Bottles"**

### Step 2: Set Industry (CRITICAL!)
1. Go to **Settings → Brand Studio**
2. Select: **"Luxury Goods & Craft"**
3. Select sub-industry: **"Artisan & Craft Goods"**
4. Click **Save**

**⚠️ DO NOT select "Fragrance & Beauty"** - Best Bottles SUPPLIES bottles to perfume brands, they're not a perfume company!

### Step 3: Upload Brand Brain
1. Go to **Settings → Brand Knowledge** or **Onboarding → Brand Knowledge Center**
2. Upload `BEST_BOTTLES_BRAND_BRAIN.md`
3. Wait for processing to complete (this may take 1-2 minutes)

### Step 4: Verify It Worked

Run this in **Supabase SQL Editor**:

```sql
-- Find Best Bottles organization
SELECT 
  o.id as org_id,
  o.name as org_name,
  o.brand_config->'industry_config'->>'id' as industry,
  o.brand_config->'industry_config'->>'sub_industry' as sub_industry
FROM organizations o
WHERE o.name ILIKE '%best bottles%'
ORDER BY o.created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Check brand knowledge (use org_id from above)
SELECT 
  knowledge_type,
  content->'business_type' as business_type,
  content->'brand_essence' as brand_essence,
  content->'core_philosophy' as core_philosophy
FROM brand_knowledge 
WHERE organization_id = 'ORG_ID_FROM_ABOVE'
AND knowledge_type = 'brandIdentity';

-- Check for pollution (should return ZERO rows)
SELECT knowledge_type, created_at
FROM brand_knowledge
WHERE organization_id = 'ORG_ID_FROM_ABOVE'
AND knowledge_type IN (
  'category_personal_fragrance',
  'category_home_fragrance',
  'category_skincare'
);
```

**Expected Results:**

#### Query 1 (Organization):
- `industry`: `luxury-goods`
- `sub_industry`: `artisan-craft`

#### Query 2 (Brand Identity):
- `business_type`: "Premium Perfume Bottle Supplier & Design Partner"
- `brand_essence`: "Muted Luxury, Sustainability, Craftsmanship, Client-Centricity"
- `core_philosophy`: "The vessel is as vital as the scent it holds"

#### Query 3 (Pollution Check):
- **Should return ZERO rows** (no fragrance categories)

**🚨 Red Flags:**
- Industry is `fragrance-beauty` → Wrong industry selected
- business_type mentions "perfume brand" → Document processed incorrectly
- Query 3 returns rows → Old fragrance data polluting the knowledge base

- ❌ "Hand-crafted by our artisans"

### Fragrance Brand Language (WRONG):
- ❌ "Our signature fragrances"
- ❌ "Scent profiles" or "fragrance notes"
- ❌ "Our perfume collection"
- ❌ Sensory descriptions of fragrances
- ❌ "Indulge in luxury" (consumer language)
- ❌ B2C marketing tone

### Visual Mistakes (WRONG):
- ❌ Bright, colorful backgrounds
- ❌ Pure white (`#FFFFFF`) backgrounds
- ❌ Cluttered compositions
- ❌ Trendy or flashy styling
- ❌ No negative space

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Madison says "we manufacture" or "our factory"

**Diagnosis:**
- Brand brain processed incorrectly
- Old manufacturing language in `brand_knowledge`

**Fix:**
1. Check `brandIdentity` in database (Query 2 above)
2. Look for incorrect `business_type` or `what_we_do`
3. Delete all `brand_knowledge` entries for Best Bottles
4. Re-upload `BEST_BOTTLES_BRAND_BRAIN.md`

```sql
-- Delete all brand knowledge for Best Bottles
DELETE FROM brand_knowledge
WHERE organization_id = 'ORG_ID_HERE';

-- Then re-upload the document
```

---

### Problem: Madison talks about fragrances or scent profiles

**Diagnosis:**
- Industry set to "Fragrance & Beauty" instead of "Luxury Goods"
- Old fragrance categories in `brand_knowledge`

**Fix:**
1. Go to **Settings → Brand Studio**
2. Change industry to **"Luxury Goods & Craft"** → **"Artisan & Craft Goods"**
3. Run Query 3 (pollution check) - if it returns rows, delete them:

```sql
-- Delete fragrance pollution
DELETE FROM brand_knowledge
WHERE organization_id = 'ORG_ID_HERE'
AND knowledge_type IN (
  'category_personal_fragrance',
  'category_home_fragrance',
  'category_skincare'
);
```

---

### Problem: Tone is too casual or uses wrong colors

**Diagnosis:**
- Visual identity not extracted correctly
- Brand voice not in `brand_knowledge`

**Fix:**
1. Check for `brand_voice` entry:

```sql
SELECT content
FROM brand_knowledge
WHERE organization_id = 'ORG_ID_HERE'
AND knowledge_type = 'brand_voice';
```

2. If missing or incorrect, re-upload brand brain
3. In prompts, explicitly remind Madison: "Use the Muted Luxury aesthetic with warm off-white backgrounds and muted tones"

---

### Problem: Madison quotes specific prices

**Diagnosis:**
- Not following pricing rules from brand brain

**Fix:**
- In prompt, add: "Refer to bulk pricing tiers generally, don't quote specific prices"
- Check that brand brain has pricing philosophy section

---

## 📊 Expected Database State

After successful setup, your `brand_knowledge` table should contain:

```sql
-- Expected knowledge_type entries:
knowledge_type              | Should Contain
----------------------------|------------------
brandIdentity               | "supplier," "source," "B2B," "Muted Luxury"
brand_voice                 | "sophisticated," "warm," "professional," "Grace"
vocabulary                  | "MOQ," "lead time," "sourcing," "curated"
writing_examples            | B2B examples (email pitches, product descriptions)
structural_guidelines       | Professional, detailed, specific, technical
```

**Should NOT contain:**
- ❌ `category_personal_fragrance`
- ❌ `category_home_fragrance`
- ❌ `category_skincare`
- ❌ Any fragrance-specific categories

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Use B2B-Focused Prompts
**Good:**
- "Write a capabilities brochure for Best Bottles"
- "Create a case study for a luxury perfume brand client"
- "Draft an email to a potential niche fragrance brand"
- "Write a product description for our 9ml roll-on bottles targeting artisan perfumers"

**Avoid:**
- "Write a product description" (too vague)
- "Create Instagram captions" (unless specifically B2B audience)
- "Write for customers" (ambiguous - customers are brands, not consumers)

### 2. Remind Madison of Aesthetic
If visual content doesn't match "Muted Luxury":
- Add to prompt: "Use cinematic lighting, minimalist composition, warm off-white background, muted tones"

### 3. Emphasize Sourcing, Not Manufacturing
If Madison slips into manufacturing language:
- Add to prompt: "Remember, Best Bottles sources bottles from global partners - we don't manufacture them ourselves"

### 4. Test with Edge Cases
Try prompts that might confuse Madison:
- "Describe our manufacturing process" → Should say "sourcing process" or "partner network"
- "Tell me about our fragrances" → Should clarify "we supply bottles TO fragrance brands"
- "What makes our perfumes special?" → Should redirect to "what makes our bottles special"
