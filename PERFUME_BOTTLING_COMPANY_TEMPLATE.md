# About [Company Name]

[Company Name] is a luxury perfume bottle manufacturer specializing in bespoke glass vessels for premium fragrance brands. We combine traditional glassmaking artistry with modern precision manufacturing to create bottles that are as beautiful as the fragrances they hold.

## Our Story

[Founded in YEAR / Family legacy / Artisan heritage story]

We believe that a perfume bottle is more than packaging - it's the first touch point between a customer and a fragrance. It sets expectations, communicates value, and becomes a treasured object long after the perfume is gone.

## What Makes Us Different

### Artisan Craftsmanship
Every bottle begins with our master glassmakers who bring [X] years of combined experience. We use traditional techniques passed down through generations, combined with modern precision tooling.

### Custom Design Partnership
We don't just manufacture bottles - we partner with brands to bring their vision to life. From initial sketches to final production, we work closely with perfumers and brand owners to ensure every detail reflects their unique identity.

### Small Batch Expertise
Unlike mass manufacturers, we specialize in small to medium production runs (100-10,000 units), making luxury accessible to niche and artisan brands.

### Quality Standards
- Every bottle is individually inspected
- Strict tolerances for cap fit and seal integrity
- Premium glass formulations (lead-free, UV-resistant options)
- Sustainable sourcing and production practices

## Our Process

1. **Discovery & Design**: Understanding your brand, fragrance, and vision
2. **Concept Development**: Sketches, 3D renderings, and material selection
3. **Prototype Creation**: Physical samples for testing and refinement
4. **Mold Development**: Precision tooling for consistent production
5. **Production**: Artisan manufacturing with quality control at every stage
6. **Finishing**: Custom treatments (frosting, etching, plating, labeling)
7. **Packaging & Delivery**: Secure packaging and global shipping

## Minimum Order Quantities

- Custom Design (New Mold): 500 units minimum
- Existing Mold (Stock Shapes): 100 units minimum
- Limited Edition / Artist Collaborations: Case by case

## Lead Times

- Initial Design & Prototyping: 4-6 weeks

## COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATION

### What Sets Us Apart

**vs. Mass Manufacturers (Gerresheimer, Pochet du Courval)**
- We offer low MOQs (100-500 vs. 50,000+)
- Custom design partnership, not catalog selection
- Artisan quality, not industrial efficiency

**vs. Artisan Glassblowers**
- We can scale (100-10,000 units with consistency)
- Precision tooling ensures every bottle is identical
- Faster turnaround than pure hand-blown

**vs. Stock Bottle Distributors**
- Custom designs, not catalog selection
- Direct manufacturer relationship, no middleman markup
- Design consultation included

### Our Unique Position
We're the "Goldilocks" manufacturer - not too big (impersonal, high MOQs), not too small (inconsistent, can't scale), but just right for niche and emerging luxury brands.

---

## PRICING PHILOSOPHY

We don't compete on price - we compete on value. Our bottles cost more than stock catalog options because:

1. **Artisan Quality**: Hand-finished details, premium materials
2. **Custom Design**: Your vision, not a catalog compromise
3. **Reasonable MOQs**: Access to custom bottles without 50,000-unit commitments
4. **Partnership**: Design consultation, prototyping, ongoing support

**Typical Investment Range** (for transparency):
- Custom Mold Development: $3,000-$8,000 (one-time)
- Bottle Unit Cost: $4-$15 per bottle (depending on complexity, volume)
- Minimum Project: ~$2,500 (100 units of existing mold design)

---

## FORBIDDEN PHRASES & APPROACHES

### Never Say:
- "Affordable luxury" (contradiction)
- "Best in the industry" (let clients decide)
- "Award-winning" (unless true and recent)
- "Revolutionary" or "game-changing" (overused)
- "Treat yourself" or "indulge" (consumer language, not B2B)

### Never Do:
- Compare directly to competitors by name
- Make promises we can't keep (lead times, pricing)
- Use stock photography (always show real bottles)
- Oversell or use high-pressure tactics
- Speak down to smaller brands (everyone starts somewhere)

---

## SAMPLE CONTENT EXAMPLES

### Good Example (Product Description):
"The Atelier Series features hand-blown glass with a distinctive weight and presence. Each 50ml bottle is individually crafted by our master glassmakers, then precision-polished to ensure a flawless surface. The custom brass cap is hand-finished with a brushed patina that develops character over time. Minimum order: 250 units."

### Bad Example:
"Introducing our revolutionary new luxury bottle collection! These game-changing vessels will transform your brand and make your fragrance stand out. Affordable luxury has never looked this good. Treat your customers to the indulgence they deserve!"

**Why it's bad**: Vague claims, marketing fluff, no specific details, uses forbidden phrases

---

## CALL-TO-ACTION LANGUAGE

### Primary CTAs:
- "Start Your Custom Design"
- "Request a Consultation"
- "See Our Portfolio"
- "Get a Quote"

### Secondary CTAs:
- "Download Our Capabilities Brochure"
- "Schedule a Studio Visit"
- "Request Material Samples"
- "Speak with a Designer"

### Avoid:
- "Buy Now" (not transactional)
- "Limited Time Offer" (not our style)
- "Don't Miss Out" (creates false urgency)

## NOTES FOR MADISON AI

When generating content for [Company Name]:

1. **We are a B2B manufacturer**, not a fragrance brand. Our customers are perfume brands.
2. **Focus on craftsmanship and partnership**, not just product specs
3. **Be specific with details**: materials, processes, timelines, MOQs
4. **Use industry terminology** correctly (zamak, neck finish, batch production)
5. **Avoid consumer fragrance language** (sensory descriptions, "indulge," "treat yourself")
6. **Emphasize our unique position**: custom quality at accessible volumes
7. **Show, don't tell**: Specific details prove quality better than adjectives
