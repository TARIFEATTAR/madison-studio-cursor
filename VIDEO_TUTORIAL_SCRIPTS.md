**[2:15-3:00] STREAK TRACKER**
- **Visual:** Click on Streak Tracker, highlight 7-day visualization
- **Narration:** "The Streak Tracker is your daily accountability partner. These seven dots represent the last seven days of activity. Green means you published, gray means you didn't.

- **Narration:** "Now for the Content Pipeline - this is where you see your content at every stage. Draft means you're still working on it. In Progress is actively being refined.

**[0:15-1:00] WHAT ARE STREAKS**
- **Visual:** Close-up of Streak Tracker showing 12-day streak
- **Narration:** "A streak is simply consecutive days you've published content. Publish today, publish tomorrow - that's a 2-day streak. Keep it going for a week, a month, or even a year. Your current streak shows right here in large numbers. See your longest streak? That's your personal record - try to beat it! The 7-day visualization shows your recent activity at a glance."

**[1:00-1:45] THE GRACE PERIOD**
- **Visual:** Animation showing grace period window, then Settings → Goals page
- **Narration:** "Here's the secret weapon: the 48-hour grace period. If you publish on Monday but skip Tuesday, you have until Wednesday at midnight to publish and keep your streak alive. This grace period saves your streak from one-off interruptions. You can adjust your weekly publishing goals in Settings → Goals & Accolades to match your capacity."

**[1:45-2:45] THE SEVEN ACCOLADES**
- **Visual:** Navigate to Settings → Goals & Accolades, scroll through all 7 accolades
- **Narration:** "Now let's talk accolades - your editorial rank. There are seven levels, each requiring more published work. You start as a 'Novice Scribe' with just one piece. At 10 pieces, you become a 'Practiced Wordsmith.' Keep going to 'Seasoned Writer,' 'Accomplished Essayist,' 'Distinguished Author,' 'Celebrated Columnist,' and finally 'Literary Master' at 100 published pieces. Each level unlocks automatically when you hit the requirement - no need to claim them manually."

**[3:30-4:15] SETTING GOALS**
- **Visual:** Navigate to Settings → Goals, show weekly goal slider
- **Narration:** "Want to customize your experience? Head to Settings → Goals & Accolades. Here you can set your weekly publishing goal - maybe you want to publish 3 times a week, or just once. Adjust this slider to match your capacity. This goal affects your grace period calculations and keeps you accountable without overwhelming you."

**[4:15-4:30] CLOSING**
- **Visual:** Return to dashboard showing both cards
- **Narration:** "Streaks keep you publishing daily. Accolades reward your total output. Together, they transform content creation from a chore into a game you can win. Now get out there and build that streak!"

**[0:20-1:00] YOUR OVERALL SCORE**
- **Visual:** Highlight overall score at top (78%), show color indicators
- **Narration:** "Your Brand Health score is a percentage from 0 to 100. This score at 78% means your brand documentation is mostly complete, but there are gaps. Scores above 90% are excellent - that's a green indicator. Between 70-90% is good, shown in yellow. Below 70% is red, indicating urgent attention needed. Your score updates instantly when you add or update brand information."

**[1:00-2:00] CATEGORY BREAKDOWN**
- **Visual:** Scroll through Category Progress section, expand a category
- **Narration:** "Now the Category Breakdown - this is where it gets detailed. Each brand category is analyzed: Brand Voice, Visual Identity, Core Values, Target Audience, Product Information, and Market Position. See these priority numbers? Priority 1 means 'fix this first' - it's critical. Priority 6 means 'nice to have but not urgent.' Each category shows three statuses: Missing components you don't have, Incomplete items that need more detail, and Complete elements that are solid. Click any category to see exactly what's missing."

**[2:00-2:45] PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS**
- **Visual:** Scroll through recommendations list, highlight priority badges
- **Narration:** "Your priority recommendations are action items ranked by impact. High priority recommendations give you the biggest score boost with the least effort. Medium priority items are important but not urgent. Low priority is for polishing and optimization. Each recommendation tells you exactly what's missing and what suggested action to take."

**[2:45-3:30] RUNNING YOUR FIRST ANALYSIS**
- **Visual:** Show 'Run Brand Health Analysis' button, loading state, then results
- **Narration:** "If you haven't run an analysis yet, click 'Run Brand Health Analysis.' Madison scans all your brand documents, guidelines, and uploaded materials. This takes about 10-20 seconds. Once complete, you'll see your score, categories, and recommendations. Run this analysis whenever you update brand documentation to track improvement."

**[3:30-4:15] UNDERSTANDING STRENGTHS**
- **Visual:** Scroll to Strengths section at bottom
- **Narration:** "Don't forget to check your Strengths section at the bottom. This shows what you're already doing well. Maybe you have excellent brand voice documentation but weak visual guidelines. Understanding your strengths helps you maintain what's working while fixing what's not. These are your foundation - protect them as you grow."

**[4:15-5:00] TAKING ACTION**
- **Visual:** Click 'Fix This Issue' on a recommendation, show Gap Wizard preview
- **Narration:** "Ready to improve your score? Every recommendation has a 'Fix This Issue' button. Click it to launch the Gap Wizard - an interactive form that walks you through adding the missing information step by step. We'll cover the Gap Wizard in detail in the next video, but know this: every piece you add improves your score instantly."

**[5:00-5:30] CLOSING**
- **Visual:** Zoom out to full Brand Health page
- **Narration:** "Brand Health isn't about perfection - it's about progress. Start with high-priority items, fill in gaps over time, and watch your score climb. A strong brand foundation means better AI suggestions, more consistent content, and a clearer voice. Aim for that 90% and you'll be unstoppable."

### Video 4: Fixing Brand Gaps with the Gap Wizard
**Duration:** 4:00  
**Target Audience:** Users actively improving brand documentation  
**Priority:** MEDIUM

#### Script

**[0:00-0:15] INTRO**
- **Visual:** Brand Health page with recommendations visible
- **Narration:** "You've seen your Brand Health score and identified gaps. Now it's time to fix them. The Gap Wizard is your step-by-step assistant for filling in missing brand information. Let's walk through it together."

**[0:15-0:45] WHAT IS A BRAND GAP**
- **Visual:** Highlight a recommendation card with missing component
- **Narration:** "A brand gap is any missing or incomplete element in your brand documentation. Maybe you haven't defined your target audience demographics, or your brand values are vague. Each gap weakens your overall brand consistency. The good news? The Gap Wizard makes fixing them simple and fast."

**[0:45-1:30] LAUNCHING THE WIZARD**
- **Visual:** Click 'Fix This Issue' button, Gap Wizard modal opens
- **Narration:** "From any recommendation card, click 'Fix This Issue' to launch the Gap Wizard. This modal shows you exactly what's missing and why it matters. See the component name at the top? That's what we're fixing. The description tells you what this component is and how it strengthens your brand. Now let's fill it in."

**[1:30-2:30] STEP-BY-STEP WALKTHROUGH**
- **Visual:** Fill out form fields, show character counts, guidance text
- **Narration:** "The wizard breaks complex brand elements into simple questions. Each field has guidance text - read this to understand what to write. Notice the character counts? These ensure you provide enough detail without overdoing it. For example, if we're adding 'Target Audience Demographics,' you might enter: 'Women aged 25-45, college-educated, interested in sustainable living and wellness.' See how specific that is? That's what we're aiming for. Fill in all required fields - they're marked with asterisks."

**[2:30-3:15] SAVING AND IMMEDIATE IMPACT**
- **Visual:** Click 'Save to Brand Guidelines,' modal closes, score updates
- **Narration:** "Once you've filled everything in, click 'Save to Brand Guidelines.' Watch what happens - the modal closes, and boom, your Brand Health score updates instantly. From 78% to 82% with just one fix. That's the power of addressing gaps. The recommendation you just fixed disappears from your list because it's now complete. Immediate feedback, immediate progress."

**[3:15-3:45] BEST PRACTICES**
- **Visual:** Show multiple recommendations, highlight priority badges
- **Narration:** "Here's how to use the Gap Wizard efficiently: Always start with high-priority items - they boost your score the most. Do one or two gaps per session - don't burn out trying to fix everything at once. Be specific in your answers - vague entries like 'everyone' for target audience won't help Madison understand your brand. And finally, re-run the Brand Health analysis after making several updates to see your progress."

**[3:45-4:00] CLOSING**
- **Visual:** Show updated Brand Health score at 90%+
- **Narration:** "The Gap Wizard turns intimidating brand documentation into manageable tasks. Fix gaps consistently, and you'll hit that 90% score before you know it. Your brand - and your content - will thank you."

### Video 5: Brand Health Score History & Tracking
**Duration:** 3:00  
**Target Audience:** Power users tracking long-term progress  
**Priority:** LOW

#### Script

**[0:00-0:15] INTRO**
- **Visual:** Brand Health page, scroll to Score History chart
- **Narration:** "Improving your brand health isn't a one-time event - it's an ongoing process. The Score History chart shows your progress over time, helping you track improvements and identify trends."

**[0:15-0:45] READING THE CHART**
- **Visual:** Hover over data points on line chart, show tooltips
- **Narration:** "This line chart shows your Brand Health score over the past several analyses. The horizontal axis is time - each point represents when you ran an analysis. The vertical axis is your score from 0 to 100%. Hover over any point to see the exact score and date. An upward trend means you're improving. Flat lines mean you're maintaining. Downward trends - rare but possible - mean something's been removed or incomplete."

**[0:45-1:30] UNDERSTANDING SCORE TRENDS**
- **Visual:** Show example chart with gradual improvement from 65% to 92%
- **Narration:** "Most users see gradual improvement over weeks or months. You might start at 65%, add brand voice guidelines and jump to 72%. Fill in target audience demographics, hit 78%. Complete visual identity standards, reach 85%. Each gap you fill moves the needle. Sudden big jumps usually mean you uploaded comprehensive brand documentation. Slow, steady climbs mean you're using the Gap Wizard consistently."

**[1:30-2:15] WHEN TO RE-RUN ANALYSIS**
- **Visual:** Show 'Run Brand Health Analysis' button, then calendar view
- **Narration:** "When should you re-run the analysis? After uploading new brand documents, definitely run it. After fixing 3-5 gaps with the Gap Wizard, run it to see your progress. Or set a monthly schedule - first of every month, check your brand health. Don't run it daily - you need time to make meaningful changes between analyses."

**[2:15-2:45] SETTING IMPROVEMENT GOALS**
- **Visual:** Show score of 78%, highlight target of 90%
- **Narration:** "Use the chart to set realistic goals. If you're at 78%, aim for 85% within a month. From 85%, target 90% in another month. That final push from 90% to 95% or higher is polish - low-priority items and edge cases. Don't obsess over perfection. A score above 90% means your brand foundation is rock-solid."

**[2:45-3:00] CLOSING**
- **Visual:** Zoom out to full Brand Health page with history chart
- **Narration:** "Track your score, celebrate improvements, and stay consistent. Your Brand Health journey is a marathon, not a sprint. Check this chart regularly, and you'll see your brand grow stronger over time."

**[0:15-1:00] SETTING WEEKLY GOALS**
- **Visual:** Highlight weekly goal slider, adjust from 3 to 5 pieces per week
- **Narration:** "At the top, you'll find your weekly publishing goal. This slider lets you set how many pieces you want to publish each week. Slide it to match your capacity - maybe you publish 3 times a week, or 7, or just once. This isn't a hard limit, it's a target. Madison uses this number to calculate streak grace periods and provide realistic recommendations. Be honest about what's sustainable for you."

**[1:00-1:45] VIEWING ALL ACCOLADES**
- **Visual:** Scroll through all 7 accolade cards, highlight locked vs unlocked
- **Narration:** "Below your goals, you'll see all seven Editorial Accolades displayed as cards. Green with a checkmark means you've earned it - congratulations! Gray and locked means you haven't reached that level yet. Each card shows the exact requirement: Novice Scribe needs 1 piece, Practiced Wordsmith needs 10, all the way up to Literary Master at 100 published pieces."

**[1:45-2:30] TRACKING PROGRESS**
- **Visual:** Click on a locked accolade, show progress details
- **Narration:** "Click any locked accolade to see how close you are. See this progress indicator? 'You have 23 published pieces. You need 25 to unlock Accomplished Essayist.' That's only 2 pieces away! This granular tracking helps you set short-term milestones. Don't focus on Literary Master right away - celebrate each level as you climb."

**[2:30-3:00] UNDERSTANDING REQUIREMENTS**

### Video 7: Training Madison with Custom Documents
**Duration:** 4:00  
**Target Audience:** Advanced users customizing Madison AI  
**Priority:** MEDIUM

#### Script

**[0:00-0:20] INTRO**
- **Visual:** Navigate to Settings → Madison's Training tab
- **Narration:** "Madison is your AI editorial assistant, but out of the box, she only knows general best practices. The Madison's Training tab lets you teach her about your specific industry, niche, or unique content approach. Let's unlock Madison's full potential."

**[0:20-1:00] TRAINING VS BRAND GUIDELINES**
- **Visual:** Split screen showing Brand Guidelines tab vs Madison's Training tab
- **Narration:** "First, understand the difference. Brand Guidelines are your visual identity, voice, and values - the foundation of who you are. Madison's Training is how you create content - your editorial process, content formulas, SEO strategies, or industry-specific knowledge. For example, Brand Guidelines might say 'our voice is friendly and approachable.' Training documents might explain 'here's our 5-step blog post structure' or 'these are our SEO keyword research methods.'"

**[1:00-1:45] WHAT TO UPLOAD**
- **Visual:** Show upload interface, list example document types
- **Narration:** "What should you upload to Madison's Training? Content templates you use repeatedly - blog post outlines, email sequences, social media frameworks. Editorial style guides beyond voice - AP style rules, industry jargon guidelines, formatting standards. Process documents - your keyword research workflow, image sourcing checklist, or publication approval process. And niche expertise - if you write about finance, upload compliance guidelines. If you create recipes, upload your testing methodology."

**[1:45-2:30] UPLOADING DOCUMENTS**
- **Visual:** Click 'Upload Training Document,' select PDF, see processing state
- **Narration:** "To upload a document, click 'Upload Training Document.' Choose your PDF or text file - Madison accepts most common formats. Once uploaded, you'll see a processing state. Madison is reading and analyzing the document, extracting patterns and knowledge. This takes 10-30 seconds depending on file size. Once processed, the status changes to 'Ready' with a green checkmark."

**[2:30-3:15] HOW TRAINING IMPROVES MADISON**
- **Visual:** Show before/after example of Madison suggestions with and without training
- **Narration:** "Here's where it gets powerful. Without training, Madison might suggest generic blog titles like 'Top 10 Tips for Better Productivity.' With training documents about your niche - say, productivity for creative entrepreneurs - Madison suggests '10 Time-Blocking Strategies for Solopreneurs Juggling Client Work and Personal Projects.' See the difference? Specificity, terminology, and structure that matches your uploaded knowledge. Madison learns your approach and mirrors it."

**[3:15-3:45] MANAGING TRAINING DOCUMENTS**
- **Visual:** Show list of uploaded documents, delete a document
- **Narration:** "You can manage all training documents from this page. See the list? Each document shows its name, upload date, and status. Need to remove outdated information? Click the trash icon to delete a document. Madison immediately stops referencing it. You can upload multiple documents - there's no limit. Layer your knowledge to make Madison smarter over time."

**[3:45-4:00] CLOSING**
- **Visual:** Return to training document list with multiple files uploaded
- **Narration:** "Training Madison is optional but powerful. The more you teach her about your unique approach, the better her suggestions become. Upload your best templates, your proven workflows, and your niche expertise. Watch Madison transform from generic assistant to your personal editorial expert."

**Target Audience:** Users needing task management  
**Priority:** MEDIUM

#### Script

**[0:00-0:15] INTRO**
- **Visual:** Calendar page with sidebar showing Tasks tab active
- **Narration:** "Your content calendar isn't just for scheduling posts - it's also for managing tasks and notes. The calendar sidebar gives you two powerful tools: Tasks and Notes. Let's explore both."

**[0:15-1:00] THE TASKS TAB**
- **Visual:** Click Tasks tab, show task list for selected date
- **Narration:** "Click the Tasks tab in the sidebar to see all tasks for the selected date. Tasks are actionable to-dos tied to specific days. Maybe you need to 'Research keywords for blog post' on Monday, or 'Review final draft' on Thursday. Each task has a checkbox - click it when complete. Completed tasks get a strikethrough and move to the bottom of the list. This keeps your focus on what's still pending."

**[1:00-1:45] CREATING TASKS**
- **Visual:** Click date on calendar, show task input field, add a task
- **Narration:** "To create a task, first click a date on the calendar - that selects the day. Then in the Tasks tab, you'll see an input field labeled 'Add a task for [date].' Type your task, like 'Draft social media captions,' and press Enter or click Add. Boom, task created. It appears in the list immediately. You can add as many tasks as needed for any date."

**[1:45-2:15] THE NOTES TAB**
- **Visual:** Click Notes tab, show note input for selected date
- **Narration:** "Now switch to the Notes tab. Notes are for free-form thoughts, observations, or context for a specific day. Unlike tasks, notes don't have checkboxes - they're just text. Maybe you want to remember 'Great engagement on Instagram today' or 'Competitor launched similar product.' Click a date, switch to Notes, and type away. Your note is saved automatically."

**[2:15-2:45] WHEN TO USE TASKS VS NOTES**
- **Visual:** Split screen showing task example vs note example
- **Narration:** "Use tasks for actionable items with clear completion states. Use notes for context, ideas, or observations. For example, 'Publish blog post' is a task. 'Blog topic idea: How to batch content for busy weeks' is a note. Tasks drive action. Notes capture knowledge. Both live alongside your scheduled content."

**[2:45-3:00] CLOSING**
- **Visual:** Calendar view with both tasks and notes visible, scheduled content on calendar
- **Narration:** "Tasks and Notes turn your calendar into a complete editorial workspace. Manage action items, capture ideas, and schedule content all in one place. Try both features and find the workflow that fits your process."

### Video 9: Drag-and-Drop Scheduling
**Duration:** 2:30  
**Target Audience:** Power users managing lots of scheduled content  
**Priority:** LOW

#### Script

**[0:00-0:15] INTRO**
- **Visual:** Calendar week view with multiple scheduled items
- **Narration:** "Need to move a scheduled post from Tuesday to Friday? The drag-and-drop feature makes rescheduling instant and intuitive. No clicking through menus - just grab and move. Let's see it in action."

**[0:15-0:45] HOW TO DRAG-AND-DROP**
- **Visual:** Hover over scheduled item, show drag cursor, drag to new date
- **Narration:** "Find the scheduled item you want to move. Hover over it until your cursor changes to a grab hand. Click and hold, then drag the item to the new date. See that visual feedback? The item follows your cursor. Drop it on the target date, and release. Done. The post is now scheduled for the new day."

**[0:45-1:15] VISUAL FEEDBACK**
- **Visual:** Demonstrate dragging with highlight on target date, show drop animation
- **Narration:** "Notice the visual cues as you drag. The target date highlights when you hover over it - that's where the item will land. The dragged item becomes slightly transparent, so you can see what's underneath. When you drop, there's a subtle animation confirming the move. These visual hints make dragging feel natural and prevent mistakes."

**[1:15-1:45] AUTO-SYNC WITH GOOGLE CALENDAR**
- **Visual:** Show calendar with Google Calendar connected indicator
- **Narration:** "If you've connected your Google Calendar, here's the magic: drag-and-drop updates sync automatically. Move a post from Monday to Wednesday in Madison, and Google Calendar updates within seconds. No manual syncing, no double entry. Your external calendar stays perfectly in sync with your editorial calendar."

**[1:45-2:15] BEST PRACTICES**
- **Visual:** Demonstrate moving multiple items quickly in succession
- **Narration:** "Use drag-and-drop for quick adjustments. Planning changed? Drag that Monday post to Thursday. New priority came up? Move Friday's content to today. This feature shines when you're batch-rescheduling - maybe you're shifting an entire week of content forward because of a product delay. Drag each item one by one, and you're done in seconds."

**[2:15-2:30] CLOSING**
- **Visual:** Calendar with all items properly distributed across the week
- **Narration:** "Drag-and-drop scheduling removes friction from your workflow. Reschedule with a single motion, stay flexible, and keep your calendar perfectly organized. Grab, drag, drop - that's it!"
