**❌ Bad Example:**
- Quality

- Customer Service

**✅ Good Example:**
1. **Intentional Craft** - Every product is hand-poured in small batches, never mass-produced. We prioritize quality over quantity and take time to do things right.

2. **Natural Ingredients** - We use 100% soy wax and essential oils, never synthetic fragrances. Our commitment to natural ingredients is non-negotiable.

3. **Slow Living** - We encourage people to slow down, not consume faster. Our products are designed to create moments of pause, not urgency.

4. **Transparency** - We share our process, our suppliers, our story. No hidden ingredients, no marketing fluff, just honest communication.

5. **Timeless Design** - Our aesthetic won't look dated in 5 years. We design for longevity, not trends.

**Your Brand Values:**
```

**Requirements:** Minimum 50 characters. Be specific about your unique position.

**❌ Bad Example:**
"We're a premium brand."

**✅ Good Example:**
"We position ourselves as the artisan alternative to mass-market candles. We're not luxury (we're accessible at $35-65), but we're not cheap either. We're the thoughtful middle ground for people who care about quality and craft but don't need status symbols."

She wanted natural ingredients, beautiful scents, and packaging that didn't end up in a landfill. So she started making her own. Friends asked for them. Then friends of friends. Three years later, we're still hand-pouring every candle in small batches, but now we have a community of 10,000+ customers who share our values."

**Your Brand Voice:**
```
[Describe your brand voice - aim for 150-300 characters]




```

---

### 2.2 Tone Spectrum
**What it is:** How your tone adapts across different contexts while maintaining your voice.

**Requirements:** Describe how your tone changes (or stays consistent) across different situations.

**✅ Good Example:**
"Our tone adapts to context while maintaining our warm, thoughtful voice:

- **Educational:** 'Soy wax burns 30% longer than paraffin because it has a lower melting point. This means your candle lasts longer and burns more evenly.'

- **Inspirational:** 'Light this when you need to reset your day. Take three deep breaths. Let the scent anchor you in this moment.'

- **Practical:** 'Trim your wick to 1/4 inch before each burn. This prevents soot and ensures an even burn.'

- **Celebratory:** 'You did it. You found your signature scent. This is the one you'll repurchase for years.'

- **Supportive:** 'Having trouble choosing? We've all been there. Here's how to find your perfect match...'"

**Your Tone Spectrum:**

**✅ Good Example:**
**Example 1 - Product Description:**
"In the high plateaus of Inner Mongolia, where winter temperatures drop to -40°F, the cashmere goats grow an undercoat so fine that it takes four goats to make one sweater. The herders comb it out by hand each spring—they don't shear, they comb. Slowly. This is why it's soft."

**Example 2 - Email Subject Line:**
"Your candle is ready (and it smells like your favorite memory)"

**Example 3 - Social Media Post:**
"Stop and think about the last time you truly slowed down. Not scrolling. Not multitasking. Just... being. That's what this candle is for."
