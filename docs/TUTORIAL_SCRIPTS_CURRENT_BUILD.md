## Video 1: Scan Your Brand & View Your DNA

**Duration:** 6:30  
**Target Audience:** New users setting up their brand  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Key Features:** Enhanced Brand Scanner, Brand Quick View Panel

### Script

**[0:00-0:25] OPENING HOOK**

- **Visual:** Dashboard view, highlight "Brand DNA" button/icon in navigation
- **Narration:** "Your brand has a visual DNA - colors, fonts, photography style, even the way you write. Madison can extract all of it from your website in under a minute. In this video, I'll show you how to scan your brand and instantly view your complete visual identity in Madison's new Brand Quick View Panel. Let's get started."

**[0:25-1:15] WHY BRAND SCANNING MATTERS**

- **Visual:** Show side-by-side: generic content vs brand-aligned content
- **Narration:** "Before we scan, let's talk about why this matters. When Madison understands your brand's visual DNA - your exact color palette, typography choices, photography style - she creates content that looks authentically yours. Not generic AI output. Not something that could be for any brand. Content that feels like it came from your team. The Brand Scanner uses advanced visual analysis to extract everything: your logo, color codes, font families, visual mood, even your brand's tone. It's like giving Madison a complete brand style guide automatically."

**[1:15-2:30] SCANNING YOUR WEBSITE**

- **Visual:** Navigate to Settings → Brand Guidelines, or Onboarding flow
- **Narration:** "Let's scan your website. You can do this during onboarding or anytime in Settings. I'll navigate to Brand Guidelines. See this 'Scan Website' option? Click it. Now enter your website URL - I'll use a sample brand. Click 'Scan' and watch what happens. Madison is now capturing a screenshot of your homepage, analyzing every pixel, extracting colors, fonts, visual elements. This is Pomelli-style visual analysis - it's not just reading HTML, it's actually seeing your brand the way a human designer would. The scan takes about 30-60 seconds. You'll see progress indicators: capturing screenshot, analyzing visuals, extracting colors, identifying typography, assigning brand squads. Brand squads? We'll get to that in a moment."

**[2:30-3:45] WHAT MADISON EXTRACTS**

- **Visual:** Show scan results loading, then reveal Brand Quick View Panel
- **Narration:** "Scan complete! Look at everything Madison extracted. Your logo - automatically detected and saved. Your color palette - primary, secondary, accent colors with exact hex codes. Your typography - headline and body fonts identified. Your visual style - is it minimalist? Editorial? Bold and disruptive? Your photography mood - warm and inviting? Cool and professional? Even your brand tone - sophisticated, friendly, authoritative. All of this gets stored in Madison's Brand DNA system. But here's the best part - you can view it all instantly."

**[3:45-5:00] BRAND QUICK VIEW PANEL**

- **Visual:** Click Brand DNA button/icon, slide-out panel opens
- **Narration:** "See this Brand DNA icon in the navigation? Click it. This is the Brand Quick View Panel - your brand identity at a glance. Look at the logo preview at the top. Below that, your color palette - click any swatch to copy the hex code. Perfect for when you're designing or need exact brand colors. Your typography section shows font previews - see how your headline font looks? And your body font with sample text. Scroll down - here are your Squad Assignments. Copy Squad: The Storytellers. Visual Squad: The Minimalists. These are Madison's way of categorizing your brand's style. The Storytellers means your copy is narrative-driven, sensory, romantic. The Minimalists means your visuals are clean, clinical, white-space focused. Madison uses these to generate content that matches your style. Keep scrolling - see your keywords? These are design elements Madison identified. And at the bottom, your scan confidence score - 87% means Madison is very confident in these extractions. You can rescan anytime if your brand evolves."

**[5:00-6:00] USING YOUR BRAND DNA**

- **Visual:** Navigate to Forge, show how brand DNA influences generation
- **Narration:** "Now that Madison knows your brand DNA, watch what happens when you create content. I'll go to the Forge - Madison's content generator. When I generate a blog post or social content, Madison automatically references your brand DNA. Your colors? Used in image generation. Your typography? Suggested for text overlays. Your squad assignments? They determine the writing style and visual approach. It's like having a brand style guide built into every content generation. No more guessing if something matches your brand - Madison knows."

**[6:00-6:30] CLOSING & NEXT STEPS**

- **Visual:** Return to Brand Quick View Panel, show "Rescan" option
- **Narration:** "That's brand scanning in Madison. Your visual identity extracted, stored, and accessible anytime. Your next steps: Scan your website if you haven't. Explore your Brand Quick View Panel - familiarize yourself with your extracted DNA. Then, create your first piece of content and watch how Madison uses this information. If your brand evolves, just click 'Rescan Brand' to update everything. Your brand DNA is the foundation of everything Madison creates. Let's build on it."

## Video 2: Generate Content with Madison's 4-Agent Pipeline

**Duration:** 8:00  
**Target Audience:** Users ready to create content  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Key Features:** 4-Agent Pipeline, Router, Assembler, Generator, Editor

### Script

**[0:00-0:30] OPENING HOOK**

- **Visual:** Navigate to Forge page, show content creation form
- **Narration:** "Creating content in Madison isn't just AI generation - it's a sophisticated four-agent pipeline that ensures every piece is on-brand, strategically sound, and perfectly structured. In this video, I'll show you how Madison's Router, Assembler, Generator, and Editor agents work together to create content that sounds exactly like your brand. Let's create something together."

**[0:30-1:30] UNDERSTANDING THE 4-AGENT SYSTEM**

- **Visual:** Animated diagram showing 4 agents in sequence
- **Narration:** "Before we generate, let's understand how Madison thinks. When you submit a content brief, four specialized AI agents work in sequence. First, the Router Agent analyzes your brief and decides: which writing squad should handle this? Which visual squad? What's the awareness stage - are you introducing something new or reminding existing customers? The Router creates a strategy. Next, the Assembler Agent fetches everything Madison needs: your brand DNA, your master writing styles, product information, examples of your past content. Think of it as gathering all the reference materials. Then, the Generator Agent creates the actual content using all that context. Finally, the Editor Agent validates everything - checks for forbidden words, ensures brand tone, verifies product accuracy. It's like having a full editorial team in seconds. Let's see it in action."

**[1:30-3:00] CREATING YOUR CONTENT BRIEF**

- **Visual:** Fill out Forge form - content type, topic, product selection
- **Narration:** "I'll create a blog post about a new product launch. First, I select 'Blog Post' as the content type. Now I enter the topic - 'Introducing our new sustainable packaging line.' I'll select the product from my catalog - Madison pulls product details automatically. I can add key points I want covered. I'll add: 'Emphasize sustainability benefits, mention customer feedback, include call-to-action.' I can also specify the awareness stage - is this for people who've never heard of us? Or existing customers? I'll select 'Problem Aware' - they know about packaging waste but don't know our solution yet. This helps the Router Agent choose the right approach. Now I'll click 'Generate Content.' Watch what happens behind the scenes."

**[3:00-4:30] WATCHING THE AGENTS WORK**

- **Visual:** Show generation progress with agent indicators
- **Narration:** "See these progress indicators? 'Router analyzing strategy...' - The Router is reading my brief, checking my brand DNA, deciding this needs The Storytellers squad for narrative-driven copy, The Minimalists for clean visuals, and Problem Aware stage for the Schwartz framework. 'Assembler gathering context...' - Now the Assembler is fetching: my brand's writing examples, my visual masters, product details from my catalog, my brand DNA colors and fonts, even examples of similar content I've created before. 'Generator creating content...' - The Generator is writing, using all that context. It's referencing my master writing style - maybe Ogilvy for persuasive copy, or Peterman for sensory storytelling. It's using my brand colors in image prompts. It's structuring content using the Schwartz Problem Aware template. 'Editor validating...' - Finally, the Editor checks: no forbidden words? Brand tone correct? Product details accurate? Structure follows the template? All good. Content ready."

**[4:30-6:00] REVIEWING THE OUTPUT**

- **Visual:** Show generated content, highlight brand-aligned elements
- **Narration:** "Here's the generated content. Look at the headline - it matches my brand voice. The structure follows the Problem Aware template - first identifying the problem, then presenting our solution. The copy style? Narrative-driven, sensory - that's The Storytellers squad at work. See these color references in the image prompt? They're from my brand DNA. The product details? Pulled directly from my catalog. Everything is on-brand because every agent had access to my complete brand knowledge. I can see which squad was assigned, which awareness stage was used, even which master writing style was referenced. This transparency helps me understand how Madison thinks."

**[6:00-7:15] REFINING WITH THE EDITOR**

- **Visual:** Show Editor suggestions, make refinements
- **Narration:** "The Editor Agent already validated this, but I can refine further. I'll click 'Refine' and ask Madison to make the opening more compelling, or adjust the tone to be more conversational. Madison will regenerate just that section, keeping everything else intact. I can also use the Editor to check specific things - 'Does this match our brand tone?' 'Are there any forbidden words?' 'Is the product information accurate?' The Editor Agent gives me confidence that every piece meets our standards before I publish."

**[7:15-8:00] CLOSING & BEST PRACTICES**

- **Visual:** Show saved content in library, highlight quality
- **Narration:** "That's content generation with Madison's 4-Agent Pipeline. Every piece goes through Router strategy, Assembler context-gathering, Generator creation, and Editor validation. The result? Content that sounds like your brand, uses your exact colors and fonts, references your products accurately, and follows proven frameworks. Your best practices: Provide detailed briefs - the more context, the better the Router's strategy. Keep your brand DNA updated - rescan if your brand evolves. Review the squad assignments - they tell you how Madison interpreted your brief. Use the Editor for final polish - it catches things you might miss. Now go create something remarkable."

### Script

**[0:00-0:25] OPENING HOOK**

Madison's Image Editor now includes one-click background removal powered by advanced AI. In this video, I'll show you how to remove backgrounds, compare before and after, and export professional product images. Let's edit."

**[0:25-1:30] OPENING THE IMAGE EDITOR**

- **Visual:** Click on an image, Image Editor Modal opens
- **Narration:** "I'll click on this product image from my library. The Image Editor Modal opens - this is your complete image editing workspace. You can see tabs at the top: Refine, Variations, Text, Ad, and our new tab - BG Remove. That's background removal. I'll click it. This tab is dedicated to removing backgrounds from your images. Perfect for product shots, headshots, or any image where you need a transparent background."

**[1:30-3:00] REMOVING THE BACKGROUND**

- **Visual:** Click "Remove Background" button, show processing
- **Narration:** "I'll click 'Remove Background.' Madison is now processing this image using advanced AI models. She's analyzing every pixel, identifying the subject, separating it from the background. This takes about 10-20 seconds. You'll see a progress indicator - 'AI is working its magic...' - and then, done! Look at the result. The background is completely removed, showing a checkerboard pattern which indicates transparency. The product is perfectly isolated. No manual masking, no complex tools - just one click. Madison uses multiple AI providers in the background - fal.ai, Replicate, PhotoRoom - so you get the best quality result every time."

**[3:00-4:15] BEFORE/AFTER COMPARISON**

- **Visual:** Toggle comparison slider, drag to compare
- **Narration:** "Want to see the difference? Click 'Show comparison.' Now I have a slider view - I can drag left and right to compare the original and the processed image side-by-side. Drag left to see more of the original, drag right to see more of the result. This is perfect for verifying the quality before you download. The subject should be perfectly isolated with clean edges. No artifacts, no leftover background pixels. If something looks off, you can click 'Remove from different image' to try again with a different source."

**[4:15-5:00] DOWNLOADING & SAVING**

- **Visual:** Click "Download PNG", then "Save to Library"
- **Narration:** "Once you're happy with the result, you have two options. 'Download PNG' saves the transparent image directly to your computer - perfect for immediate use in design tools or websites. 'Save to Library' stores it in Madison's image library so you can use it in future content. I'll download it. The file is saved as a PNG with transparency - ready to use anywhere. I can also save it to my library for later. Now I have a professional product image with a transparent background, ready for any use case."

**[5:00-5:30] CLOSING & TIPS**

- **Visual:** Show multiple product images with backgrounds removed
- **Narration:** "That's background removal in Madison. One click, professional results, instant download. Tips for best results: Product images with clear edges work best. Good lighting helps distinguish the subject. Avoid complex backgrounds with similar colors to your product. Use the comparison slider to verify quality before downloading.
