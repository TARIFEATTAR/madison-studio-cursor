- **Voiceover:** "Welcome to Madison Studio. You now have an AI-powered editorial director, brand guardian, and production team—all in one platform. In this series, I’ll show you how to turn your brand’s voice into a consistent, high-quality content engine. Let’s start with your command center: the Dashboard."

**[0:45-1:30] THE DASHBOARD TOUR**
- **Visual:** Pan across Brand Health, Content Pipeline, and Streak Tracker.
- **Voiceover:** "This is your home base. Top left is your **Brand Health Score**—we’ll talk about that next. In the center is your **Content Pipeline**, showing everything from 'Draft' to 'Published.' And over here is your **Streak Tracker**, keeping you accountable. Think of this page as your daily briefing."

**[1:30-2:30] NAVIGATION BASICS**
- **Visual:** Hover over sidebar icons: Forge, Multiply, Library, Calendar, Settings.
- **Voiceover:** "On the left is your navigation. **The Forge** is where you create new content. **Multiply** is where you repurpose that content for every channel. **The Library** holds your archives, and **Calendar** is your schedule. Finally, **Settings** is where you train Madison. Let’s begin by giving Madison her brain."

**[2:30-3:00] CALL TO ACTION**

**Goal:** Complete brand setup journey from first login through deep brand configuration.

**[0:00-0:20] INTRO: THE BRAND SETUP JOURNEY**
- **Visual:** Fade in to the onboarding welcome screen (Step 1 of 3).
- **Voiceover:** "Welcome back. When you first log into Madison Studio, you'll see this onboarding flow. This is where we start teaching Madison about your brand. Let me show you the complete journey—from quick setup to deep brand intelligence."

**[0:20-1:30] ONBOARDING STEP 1: BRAND BASICS**
- **Visual:** Fill in the onboarding form: First Name ("Jordan"), Brand Name ("Luna & Sage"), Industry (select "Home & Lifestyle"), show the color picker briefly.
- **Voiceover:** "Step one is simple. Enter your first name—this is how Madison will address you. Then your brand name—we're using 'Luna & Sage' as our example. Select your industry from the dropdown—this helps Madison understand your context. You can also set a primary brand color here. Click 'Continue' when you're ready."

**[1:30-2:30] ONBOARDING STEP 2: BRAND DNA SCAN (OPTIONAL)**
- **Visual:** Show the Brand DNA Scan screen. Enter a website URL (e.g., "lunaandsage.com"), click "Start Scan," show the scanning animation (analyzing → colors → fonts → images), then show the extracted data preview.
- **Voiceover:** "Next, you have an option: the Brand DNA Scan. If you have an existing website, enter its URL here. Madison will intelligently analyze your site—extracting your color palette, typography, logo, and even your brand's visual style. Watch as she processes: analyzing structure, identifying colors, detecting fonts, and cataloging images. This gives Madison a powerful head start on understanding your visual identity. You can skip this step if you don't have a website yet, or if you prefer to upload documents instead."

**[2:30-3:00] ONBOARDING STEP 3: DOCUMENT UPLOAD (OPTIONAL)**
- **Visual:** Show the document upload screen. Briefly drag a PDF into the upload zone, show it processing.
- **Voiceover:** "Step three is optional but powerful: upload your brand documents. Drag in your brand guidelines PDF, style guide, or any document that defines your brand. Madison reads these instantly. We'll dive deeper into this in Settings, but this quick upload during onboarding gets you started fast."

**[3:00-3:15] ONBOARDING COMPLETE**
- **Visual:** Show the success screen briefly, then transition to the dashboard.
- **Voiceover:** "Once you complete onboarding, you'll land on your dashboard. But we're not done yet. The onboarding flow gives Madison the basics. Now, let's give her the deep intelligence she needs to create truly on-brand content."

**[3:15-4:00] TRANSITION TO SETTINGS: WHY DEEP SETUP MATTERS**
- **Visual:** Navigate to Settings > Brand Guidelines tab.
- **Voiceover:** "Onboarding is your quick start. But in **Settings**, under **Brand Guidelines**, we go deeper. This is where you define your voice, values, visual standards, and all the nuances that make your brand unique. This is the most important step you will take."

**[4:00-5:00] UPLOADING YOUR BRAND DNA**
- **Visual:** Clicking "Upload Brand Document" and selecting a PDF (e.g., "Luna & Sage Brand Guide.pdf"). Show the upload progress, then show extracted content preview.
- **Voiceover:** "Click 'Upload Brand Document.' You can drag in your brand book, style guide, or even an 'About Us' page. Madison reads these instantly. Watch as she extracts your color palette, fonts, core values, voice guidelines, and even visual do's and don'ts. This becomes her 'North Star' for every sentence she writes and every image she briefs."

**[5:00-5:45] DEFINING YOUR VOICE MANUALLY**
- **Visual:** Scrolling to the "Voice & Tone" section, filling in fields: "Brand Voice & Tone," "Forbidden Phrases," "Brand Story."
- **Voiceover:** "Even without documents, you can manually input your brand's core identity. Define your 'Brand Voice & Tone'—are you witty or serious? Luxurious or accessible? List your 'Forbidden Phrases'—words Madison should never use. Craft your 'Brand Story' and detail your 'Target Audience.' Every field you complete here makes Madison smarter and your content more consistent."

**[5:45-6:30] THE BRAND HEALTH SCORE & CLOSING**
- **Visual:** Show the Brand Health Score increasing (e.g., 65% → 92% for Luna & Sage). Click on the score to show the full analysis.
- **Voiceover:** "As you fill this out, watch your **Brand Health Score** climb. We started at 65% after onboarding. Now, with documents uploaded and key fields defined, we're at 92%. Aim for at least 90%. A high score means Madison understands you perfectly. Click on the score to see a detailed breakdown of what's complete and what's missing. Once you hit green, you're ready to create. In the next video, we'll explore what makes 'good' brand guidelines and how they impact Madison's output."

**Goal:** explaining what makes "good" training data.

**[0:00-1:00] GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT**
- **Visual:** Showing a well-structured brand document vs. a vague one.
- **Voiceover:** "Madison is smart, but she needs clear instructions. In this video, I’ll show you what 'good' brand guidelines look like. Vague inputs like 'be professional' give generic results. Specific inputs like 'use short, punchy sentences like Ernest Hemingway' give you magic."

**[1:00-2:30] THE ESSENTIALS**
- **Visual:** Highlighting key sections: Mission, Audience, Tone.
- **Voiceover:** "Make sure your uploaded documents include three things: 1) Your Mission—why you exist. 2) Your Target Audience—who you’re talking to. and 3) Your Tone—how you sound. If you have examples of past content you love, upload those too. Madison loves examples."

**[2:30-3:30] THE VISUAL STANDARD**
- **Visual:** Settings > Visual Standards card.
- **Voiceover:** "Don't forget visuals. You can upload guidelines for photography style, too. This ensures that when Madison briefs an image, she asks for 'warm, golden-hour lighting' instead of just 'a photo of a product.' Clear guidelines equal consistent brands."

- **Visual:** Selecting a "Thought Leadership Article" template.

- **Visual:** Generating an email blast about the candle.
