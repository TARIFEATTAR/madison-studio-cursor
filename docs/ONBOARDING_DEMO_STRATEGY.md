# Onboarding Demo Strategy
## How to Handle Onboarding in the Video Demo Series

**Date:** January 2025  
**Purpose:** Document the decision on how to integrate the onboarding flow into the Madison Studio demo video series.

---

## DECISION: Integrate Onboarding into Video 2

**Recommendation:** Include the onboarding flow as the opening of **Video 2: Setting Up Your Brand Identity**, rather than creating a separate video or skipping it entirely.

---

## WHY THIS APPROACH

### 1. **Matches Real User Journey**
- New users see onboarding immediately after signup/login
- It's the actual first experience, not an optional step
- Demonstrating it shows the complete brand setup journey from start to finish

### 2. **Creates Logical Flow**
- **Onboarding (Quick Setup)** → **Settings (Deep Dive)**
- Shows progression: basic info → website scan → document upload → detailed configuration
- Demonstrates that onboarding is the "quick start" and Settings is where you "go deep"

### 3. **Efficient Use of Video Time**
- Onboarding is relatively quick (3 steps, mostly optional)
- Doesn't warrant its own full video
- Fits naturally as the opening of the brand setup video
- Total video duration: 6:30 (was 5:00) - still reasonable

### 4. **Educational Value**
- Shows users what to expect on first login
- Demonstrates the Brand DNA Scan feature (unique to Madison)
- Explains the relationship between onboarding and Settings
- Sets expectations: "Onboarding gets you started, Settings makes you great"

## ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED

### Option 1: Separate Onboarding Video ❌
**Why Not:**
- Onboarding is too short for a full video (would be ~2-3 minutes)
- Creates unnecessary fragmentation
- Users might skip it thinking it's not important
- Breaks the natural flow of brand setup

### Option 2: Skip Onboarding Entirely ❌
**Why Not:**
- New users will see it first - they need to know what to expect
- Brand DNA Scan is a unique feature worth showcasing
- Missing onboarding creates a gap in the user journey
- Doesn't show the complete brand setup story

### Option 3: Brief Mention in Video 1 ✅ (Current Approach)
**Why This Works:**
- Shows complete journey in one logical video
- Demonstrates both quick start and deep setup
- Efficient use of video time
- Maintains narrative flow

---

## PRODUCTION NOTES

### For Recording:
1. **Use a Fresh Account:** Record onboarding with a brand new account to show the actual first-time experience
2. **Use "Luna & Sage" Brand:** Consistent with the fictitious brand strategy for brand guidelines videos
3. **Show Optional Steps:** Demonstrate both the Brand DNA Scan and document upload, but explain they're optional
4. **Smooth Transitions:** Use fade transitions between onboarding steps and Settings navigation
5. **Highlight Key Moments:**
   - Brand DNA Scan animation (unique feature)
   - Brand Health Score progression (visual impact)
   - Document extraction preview (shows intelligence)

### Visual Cues:
- **Onboarding:** Clean, welcoming aesthetic with progress indicators
- **Settings:** More detailed, professional interface
- **Transition:** Smooth fade from onboarding success → dashboard → Settings

### Narration Tips:
- Emphasize that onboarding is "quick start" and Settings is "deep dive"
- Explain optional vs. required steps clearly
- Connect onboarding inputs to Settings configuration
- Show how Brand Health Score improves with each step
