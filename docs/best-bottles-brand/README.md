# Best Bottles — Design System

> "Beautifully Contained." — Best Bottles is a division of Nemat International (20+ year family fragrance house) selling premium glass bottles, closures, and packaging to beauty, fragrance, and wellness brands at every stage — indie Etsy perfumers through enterprise retailers like Ulta and Whole Foods.

**Catalog scale:** 2,300+ products · 27 bottle families (Cylinder, Diva, Elegant, Empire, Boston Round, Sleek, Circle, Atomizer, Apothecary, Decorative…) · 500+ brand customers · $50 order minimum · Made-in-USA manufacturing · Free sample kits · Shopify + Sanity + Convex stack.

**The Grace layer.** Every surface carries **Grace**, an always-on AI Bottling Specialist (voice + chat) that handles the catalog's hardest problem — thread-size fitment between bottles, caps, sprayers, droppers, and roll-ons. Grace shows up as a subtle gold-tinted pulse + four vertical "voice bars" throughout the UI, and is the third homepage entry path alongside Search and the Guided Selector.

No Figma link or slide deck was provided with this project — only the marketing-site codebase. UI kit is scoped to the marketing website (`ui_kits/website/`).

## Products represented

The codebase exposes one public product (the marketing/e-commerce website) and one gated product (a customer portal).

1. **Marketing & commerce website** — `best-bottles.com`. Homepage, mega-menu navigation, catalog with rich filtering, PDP with fitment, cart/checkout, Journal (blog), About, Contact, quote/sample request forms. This is what the UI kit recreates.
2. **Portal** (`/app/(portal)`) — signed-in customer area; order history, reorders, saved fitments, quote workflow. Uses the same brand tokens with slightly darker "portal palette" (`--ink`, `--ash`, `--gold-dim`). Not recreated here; flag it as a second UI kit if needed.
3. **Grace AI** — lives *inside* the website rather than being a standalone product, but has its own visual language (breathing pulse, voice bars, side-panel docking).
4. **Sanity Studio** (`/studio`) — admin CMS. Off-brand (Sanity's own UI); not part of this system.

## Content Fundamentals

### Voice & tone
Refined, confident, technically fluent. Best Bottles reads like a **third-generation family atelier that also ships 2,300 SKUs on time** — aesthetic vocabulary from the perfume world ("silhouette," "atelier," "discovery kit," "refined 55 ml") crossed with operator-grade specificity ("Type III cosmetic," "thread size," "fitment verified," "no tariff surprises"). Never whimsical, never slangy.

### Person & address
Addresses the reader as **"you"** in calls-to-action and microcopy; uses **"we" / "our"** for the brand. First-person singular ("I") is avoided — Grace's chat is the one place where voice becomes more conversational.

### Casing rules
- **Section eyebrows** are UPPERCASE with wide tracking (`tracking-[0.25em]`). *e.g.* `FIND YOUR BOTTLE` · `ALREADY KNOW YOUR STYLE?` · `FROM THE LAB` · `OUR STORY`.
- **Headlines** are Title Case or sentence case in serif — never all-caps.
- **Button labels** are UPPERCASE with wide tracking. *e.g.* `BROWSE CATALOG`, `EXPLORE`, `VIEW ALL ARTICLES`, `SUBSCRIBE`.
- **Logo wordmark** is `BEST BOTTLES` — UPPERCASE, Cormorant semibold.
- **Body copy** is sentence case. Em dashes ( — ) used liberally for rhythm.

### Tagline & brand phrases
- Master tagline: **"Beautifully Contained."**
- Sign-off in footer: *"Beautifully Contained."* in italic muted-gold serif.
- Dark announce bar (top of every page): `Free shipping on orders above $99 · Need fitment help? Talk with Grace, AI Bottling Specialist`.
- Grace's promo line: `Your AI bottling specialist for fitment and product guidance.`

## Visual Foundations

### Palette (see `colors_and_type.css` for tokens)

**Primary** — a warm-neutral "gallery" palette, never pure white or true black.
- `--obsidian #1D1D1F` — primary text, dark announce bar, footer.
- `--bone #F5F3EF` — default page background. Warmer than off-white.
- `--muted-gold #C5A065` — brand accent, hover, active links, Grace cues, pill tints.
- `--slate #637588` — secondary text, eyebrow copy.
- `--champagne #D4C5A9` — borders and dividers (usually at `/50` opacity).
- `--linen #FAF8F5` — light surface (PathChooser, Education band).
- `--travertine #EEE6D4` — warmer image-placeholder surface.
- `--parchment #ECE5D8` / `--warm-white #FDFBF8` — secondary grid surfaces.

**Portal extensions** — `--ash #9A9590`, `--ink #2C2C2E`, `--gold-dim #8B6F42`.

**Status** — `--destructive #EF4444` (only visible color used for errors; no `success` token in code — I'm proposing `#5A8F6E` and flagging it).

**How colors stack in practice (top → bottom of homepage):**  
`bone hero (image bg)` → `linen trust bar` → `white path chooser` → `warm-white families band` → `parchment/20 social proof` → `linen education` → `linen newsletter` → `obsidian footer`. The rhythm is *light → lighter → warmest → darker → light → DARK*.

### Type
- **Display / serif — EB Garamond** — hero, all `h1/h2/h3/h4`, testimonial quotes, CTA card titles. Weight 500 is the default; 400 is used for quotes. Italic EB Garamond appears in testimonials and the footer sign-off.
- **Logo display — Cormorant** — only the `BEST BOTTLES` wordmark (Cormorant semibold, uppercase, tight tracking). Do not use elsewhere.
- **UI sans — Inter** — all body copy, nav, buttons, eyebrows, badges, meta.
- **Display size** is genuinely big: the hero uses `text-[87px]` on desktop with `line-height: 1.05`. Section titles are `text-4xl` (40px) EB Garamond.
- **Eyebrows** are a consistent pattern: `text-[10–12px]`, uppercase, `tracking-[0.25em]`, `font-semibold`, color `slate` (or `muted-gold` for the Grace accent).

### Backgrounds & imagery
- **Imagery is bottle-centric product photography** on warm neutral backdrops — amber glass, clear/frosted glass, aluminum, cream jars, vintage atomizers. Not lifestyle shots.
- **Full-bleed hero image** with a `from-obsidian/55 via-obsidian/25 to-transparent` *horizontal* gradient wash (L→R) is the signature hero treatment. Text sits in the left gutter over the darkened band.
- **Card images** use `bg-travertine` as the empty state / letterbox color while `<Image>` loads.
- **No hand-drawn illustrations. No repeating patterns or textures. No photographic grain filters.** The brand is calm, gallery-like.
- **No bluish-purple gradients.** The only gradients are: hero dark wash, subtle muted-gold/10 → champagne/40 background on mega-menu featured cards, and text-shimmer across white Grace text.

### Motion & interaction

**Animation library:** Framer Motion (`framer-motion@12`) for React animation; plus bespoke CSS keyframes for Grace's ambient loops.

- **FadeUp** is the canonical entrance: `opacity: 0, y: 30 → opacity: 1, y: 0`, `duration: 0.8`, `ease: [0.22, 1, 0.36, 1]`, triggered `whileInView` with `once: true, margin: -100px`. Used on nearly every section. Stagger delay = `i * 0.08–0.1s`.
- **Hero image** scales from `1.05 → 1` over `8s ease-out` (barely perceptible zoom).
- **Cart drawer** slides in from right, `0.45s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`.
- **Grace ambient pulse** — breathing scale `1 → 1.15 → 1` over `2s ease-in-out infinite`. Softer `gracePulseSubtle` variant (1 → 1.05) for PDP trigger.
- **Grace voice bars** — four 2px-wide bars animate height `3px → 13px` with staggered delays (`0s, .18s, .36s, .54s`) at `0.9s ease-in-out infinite`. Gold on light, white on dark.
- **Grace glow** — `0 0 16px 4px rgba(197,160,101,0.2)` box-shadow pulse on "Talk with Grace" buttons.
- **Text shimmer** — a gold highlight sweeps across white body text (`textShimmer`, 3s infinite). Used sparingly on Grace's primary CTA.
- **No bouncy springs.** No overshoot. Easing is always gentle cubic-bezier.

### Hover & press states
- **Links / nav items** — `hover:text-muted-gold` (color change, no underline shift).
- **Icon buttons** — icon color → `muted-gold` on hover.
- **Buttons (solid dark)** — `bg-obsidian` → `hover:bg-muted-gold`. Solid-gold → `hover:bg-obsidian`. (The primary CTA pattern *inverts* on hover — dark becomes gold and vice versa.)
- **White/outline buttons** — `bg-white` → `hover:bg-bone`.
- **Cards** — `border-champagne/50` → `hover:border-muted-gold hover:shadow-lg` (border color + shadow intensify; no transform). Inner image `group-hover:scale-105` zoom over `duration-700 ease-in-out`.
- **Underlines on secondary links** — `underline-offset-4 decoration-champagne hover:decoration-muted-gold`.
- **Press/active** — mobile-only card tap: `active:scale-105` on the inner image. No global press-shrink on buttons.
- **Focus ring** — `ring-2 ring-muted-gold/15–20` on inputs; `ring-muted-gold/20` on focused cards. Keyboard focus follows shadcn defaults (`ring-ring` = muted-gold).

### Borders
- Default border: `1px solid var(--champagne)` at 50–60% opacity. Visible but quiet.
- Borders thicken to full `--muted-gold` on hover/focus.
- Divider lines in the Trust Bar use `divide-x divide-champagne/60`.

### Shadows & elevation
Sparse and soft. Three layers in practice:
- **`shadow-sm`** — passive product cards, testimonial cards, Trust Bar.
- **`shadow-md`** — hero CTA button, mega-menu featured card.
- **`shadow-lg` / `shadow-xl`** — card hover state; cart drawer.
- **`shadow-2xl`** only on the mega-menu panel itself (large floating layer).

Grace adds its own glow layer (`0 0 20px 2px rgba(197, 160, 101, 0.15)`) as breathing effect — this is an *accent*, not a general elevation tool.

### Corner radii
Best Bottles is **decidedly low-radius**. The dominant corner is a *sharp* `rounded-sm` (2px). Rounded surfaces by use:

| Surface | Radius |
|---|---|
| Product cards, testimonial cards, article cards, CTA buttons | `rounded-sm` (2px) |
| Badge / pill / chip / circular icon well / dot nav / avatar | `rounded-full` |
| Search field, Grace button, nav input | `rounded-xl` (12px) |
| shadcn primitives (buttons, tables, separators) | `rounded-md` (6px) |
| Design-family large cards | `rounded-[10px]` |

Newsletter bar is pill-shaped (`rounded-full` container with a pill submit button inside). Everything else defaults to `rounded-sm`.

### Transparency & blur
- **Fixed navbar** uses a subtle backdrop treatment: `bg-bone` when at top, `bg-bone/95 shadow-sm backdrop-blur-md` once scrolled past 20px.
- **Hero text bands** use obsidian gradient overlays (55% → 25% → 0%) — no blur.
- **Overlays** (mega menu closed, mobile menu closed) use `bg-obsidian/10` and `/40` respectively.
- **Inputs** use `bg-white/60` for a soft-glass effect when the page behind is off-white.
- **Blur is used sparingly** — only on the scrolled header.

### Layout rules
- **Max content width: 1440px**, centered with `px-6` (24px) gutters on desktop and `px-4` (16px) on mobile.
- **Vertical rhythm:** major sections are `py-24` (96px) with tight sections at `py-14–16` (PathChooser) and hero at `h-[100dvh]` with `pt-[120px]` to clear the nav.
- **Fixed elements:** navbar (`z-50`), cart drawer (`z-[70]`), mega-menu overlay (`z-40`), mobile menu (`z-[60]–[61]`), Grace layout shell wraps everything.
- **Mobile tab bar padding** — `main` gets `padding-bottom: calc(3.5rem + env(safe-area-inset-bottom))` on `<1024px` so content never hides behind mobile nav.
- **Design-family carousel** uses a *full-width* horizontal scroll that starts flush with the page gutter and extends past the right edge — `pl-[max(1.5rem, calc((100vw-1440px)/2+1.5rem))]` and `pr-[10vw]`. A deliberate edge-bleeding pattern that appears in several horizontal-scroll rows.

### Imagery color vibe
**Warm, neutral, softly-lit, indoor studio.** Amber and clear glass dominate; backdrops are bone / travertine / champagne. Never cool, never blue-hour, never black-and-white, never grainy. Bottles are the hero — people rarely appear.

### Density
Medium. Cards are generous (p-6 to p-8), touch targets exceed 44px on mobile, but information density is high in the catalog grid (3–4 columns on desktop). The brand is **not minimalist** — it leans **editorial** — lots of small eyebrows, counters ("28 products"), badges, and utility meta ("tracking-[0.2em] text-[10px]").

## Iconography

**Primary icon system:** [`@phosphor-icons/react`](https://phosphoricons.com/) — all icons in the app import from `@phosphor-icons/react` via `src/components/icons.tsx`, which acts as a central barrel and alias file. Phosphor is a **thin-stroke, 1.5px, geometric** set with variants (thin/light/regular/bold/fill/duotone). The default weight used is **`regular`**, rendered at `size={16|20|24}`.

Phosphor is available via CDN at `https://unpkg.com/@phosphor-icons/react@2.1.10` and via Phosphor's own web-font loader:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@phosphor-icons/web/src/regular/style.css" />
<i class="ph ph-arrow-right"></i>
```

**Icons actually used in the codebase** (imported from `src/components/icons.tsx`):
`ArrowRight`, `ArrowLeft`, `CaretRight/Down/Up`, `X`, `List`, `House`, `MagnifyingGlass`, `User`, `ShoppingBag`, `ShoppingCart`, `Heart`, `Check`, `Plus`, `Minus`, `Trash`, `XCircle`, `WarningCircle`, `Clock`, `Calendar`, `ShieldCheck`, `Shield`, `ChatCircle`, `Headphones`, `GridFour`, `Lightning`, `Compass`, `Trophy`, `Globe`, `Users`, `BookOpen`, `Wrench`, `FileText`, `BookBookmark`, `PaperPlaneTilt`, `CheckCircle`, `CircleNotch`, `Drop`, `SprayBottle`, `Sparkle`, `Star`, `Truck`, `Package`, `SlidersHorizontal`, `ArrowsDownUp`, `Rows`, `Diamond`, `Flask`, `Medal`, `Sun`, `Leaf`, `Recycle`, `SquaresFour`, `Tag`, `Microphone`, `SpeakerHigh/Slash`, `Waveform`, `Eyedropper`, `Flower`, `Gift`, `Stack`, `Question`.

**Applicator icons** — `Roll-On`, `Spray`, `Reducer`, `Lotion Pump`, `Dropper` are **custom inline SVGs** drawn in `HomePage.tsx` (`APPLICATOR_ICONS`) at `viewBox="0 0 40 40"`, `stroke="currentColor"`, `strokeWidth="1.5"`. These match Phosphor's stroke weight for consistency. They're simple bottle silhouettes, not photoreal.

**PNG/raster iconography:** none for UI chrome. A handful of raster assets serve as *illustrative content* (product family photos, hero photos) — see `assets/`.

**Emoji:** not used anywhere. Do not introduce.

**Unicode dashes as UI:** the en-dash `–` separates ranges in mega-menu links (`Miniature — 1 to 5 ml`); the em-dash `—` is a common rhythm character in prose. Middle-dot `·` separates clauses in the dark announce bar.

**Logo:** there is a raster logo referenced at `/assets/best-bottles-logo.png` in the mobile menu — not present in the repo's `public/assets`. Main desktop logo is the **Cormorant wordmark** rendered as text. Treat the wordmark as the canonical logo; when a raster mark is needed, flag for the user to supply it.

## Caveats / substitutions

- **Fonts** — EB Garamond, Cormorant, and Inter are all served from Google Fonts in the source codebase (Next font loader), so no local `.ttf` substitution was needed. `colors_and_type.css` imports them from the Google CDN; swap to self-hosted `.woff2` for production.
- **Logo raster** — referenced at `/assets/best-bottles-logo.png` but not in the repo. UI kits use the Cormorant text wordmark. Ask user for logo PNG/SVG if needed.
- **Success color** — the codebase defines no `--color-success`. I added `#5A8F6E` as a warm-sage proposal; confirm or replace.
- **Portal UI kit** — not built. Scope was the public marketing site. Ping me to extend.
- **No Figma** — all visuals were derived from code. Pixel-exact on primitives; hero/card photography relies on the provided PNGs.
