**Template:**
```
# Writing Examples

## Good Examples (On-Brand)

### Example 1: [Context - e.g., Product Description]
"[Actual copy example]"

**Why this works:**
- [Reason 1]
- [Reason 2]
- [Reason 3]

### Example 2: [Context - e.g., Email Subject Line]
"[Actual copy example]"

**Why this works:**
- [Reason 1]
- [Reason 2]

## Bad Examples (What to Avoid)

### Example 1: [Context]

**Why to avoid:**
- [Reason 1 - e.g., too corporate, uses forbidden phrase, wrong tone]
- [Reason 2]

### Example 2: [Context]
"[Copy example that's off-brand]"

**Why to avoid:**
- [Reason 1]
- [Reason 2]
```

**Example:**
```
# Writing Examples

## Good Examples (On-Brand)

### Example 1: Product Description
"Midnight Jasmine opens with a whisper of bergamot—bright, citrusy, unexpected. As it settles, the jasmine blooms: rich, intoxicating, almost decadent. The base notes of sandalwood and vanilla create a warmth that lingers long after you've left the room. This is the scent of confidence, of quiet luxury, of moments that matter."

**Why this works:**
- Uses sensory language (whisper, blooms, lingers)
- Tells a story (journey from top to base notes)
- Connects to emotion (confidence, luxury, moments)
- Avoids clichés and marketing speak
- Specific details (bergamot, jasmine, sandalwood, vanilla)

### Example 2: Email Subject Line
"Your scent journey begins here"

**Why this works:**
- Personal ("Your")
- Action-oriented ("begins")
- Creates anticipation
- Short and impactful

## Bad Examples (What to Avoid)

### Example 1: Product Description
"Our revolutionary new fragrance is the best-in-class luxury scent that will change your life. Buy now and experience game-changing quality!"

**Why to avoid:**
- Uses multiple forbidden phrases (revolutionary, best-in-class, luxury, game-changing)
- Too salesy and pushy
- No specific details
- No sensory language
- Generic marketing speak

### Example 2: Email Subject Line
"Special Offer - Limited Time Only!"

**Why to avoid:**
- Generic and cliché
- Creates false urgency
- Doesn't reflect brand voice
- Too sales-focused
```
