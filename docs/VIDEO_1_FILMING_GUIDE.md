## 🎥 FILMING TIPS

### Pacing
- **Slow down** - Script is timed generously, but viewers need time to absorb
- **Pause** 1-2 seconds between major sections
- **Don't rush** transitions - smooth is better than fast

### Visual Clarity
- **Zoom in** on important UI elements (Brand Health score, buttons)
- **Highlight** with cursor circle or subtle zoom
- **Show, don't tell** - demonstrate features, don't just describe

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Speaking too fast (especially in opening)
- ❌ Clicking too quickly (let UI load)
- ❌ Not showing actual UI (just talking)
- ❌ Rushing the Brand Health section (it's the key feature)
- ❌ Ending abruptly (smooth fade out)

### Retake Triggers
- Audio clipping or background noise
- UI elements not loading properly
- Mouse cursor blocking important text
- Speaking too fast or stumbling over words
- Missing a key UI element
