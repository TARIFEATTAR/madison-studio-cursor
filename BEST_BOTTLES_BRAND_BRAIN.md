# About Best Bottles

Best Bottles is a premium perfume bottle supplier specializing in luxury glass vessels for fragrance brands. We source the finest bottles from artisan glassmakers worldwide and offer custom design services, making premium packaging accessible to brands of all sizes.

## Our Story

Best Bottles was founded on a simple belief: **the bottle matters as much as what's inside**. We saw too many exceptional fragrances trapped in generic packaging, and we knew there was a better way.

We built relationships with the world's finest glassmakers and bottle producers to curate a collection of premium vessels. Whether you need stock bottles delivered quickly or custom designs developed specifically for your brand, we make luxury packaging accessible.

We believe that a perfume bottle is more than packaging - it's the first touch point between a customer and a fragrance. It sets expectations, communicates value, and becomes a treasured object long after the perfume is gone.

## Our Mission

To elevate the packaging experience by providing **"Muted Luxury"** solutions that blend timeless artisanal craftsmanship with modern sustainable practices.

## Bad Example (What NOT to do):

❌ "Check out our AMAZING bottles! We manufacture the BEST glass in the world at our state-of-the-art factory! Our master glassblowers hand-craft each bottle with LUXURY in mind! Treat yourself to the FINEST bottles on the market!"

**Why this is wrong:**
- Claims we manufacture (we don't)
- Uses superlatives without proof ("BEST," "FINEST")
- Too casual/salesy tone ("AMAZING," "Treat yourself")
- Says "luxury" instead of showing it
- Mentions "our glassblowers" (we source, we don't employ them)

# Notes for Madison AI

When generating content for Best Bottles:

## Critical Rules

1. **We are a B2B supplier**, not a manufacturer or fragrance brand. Our customers are perfume brands.
2. **We source bottles**, we don't manufacture them (except custom molds through partner facilities)
3. **Keep sourcing vague**: Say "we source," "we work with," "through our network" - never claim we manufacture
4. **Focus on curation and service**, not manufacturing capabilities
5. **Be specific with details**: materials, lead times, MOQs, pricing ranges, stock availability
6. **Use industry terminology** correctly (zamak, neck finish, MOQ, lead time, roll-on, dropper, fine mist)
7. **Avoid consumer fragrance language** (sensory descriptions, "indulge," "treat yourself")
8. **Emphasize our unique position**: premium quality at competitive prices through smart sourcing and flexible MOQs
9. **Show, don't tell**: Specific details prove quality better than adjectives
10. **B2B tone**: Professional, collaborative, solution-oriented (like "Grace")
11. **Never mention "best" as a superlative** - it's our name, not a claim
12. **Focus on the bottle, not the fragrance** - we supply vessels, not perfumes

### "How much does this bottle cost?"
❌ Don't quote specific prices (they change)
✅ "Pricing varies based on volume. For 12-143 units, expect $3-$8 per bottle. For production runs of 144+, pricing drops to $2-$6 per bottle. I'd recommend using our configurator for an accurate quote based on your specific needs."

✅ "Yes, we offer custom design services through our partner facilities. We can develop custom molds starting at 500 units. The process typically takes 8-12 weeks from design approval to delivery. Would you like to discuss your vision?"

### "What's the difference between amber and clear glass?"
✅ "Amber glass provides UV protection, making it ideal for light-sensitive essential oils and fragrances. Clear glass showcases the color of your fragrance beautifully and works well for stable formulations. Both are available in our collection."

### "Do you have samples?"
✅ "Yes, we offer sampling for most stock items. You can order 1-11 units at our sampling tier pricing ($5-$12 per bottle depending on the style). This lets you test the bottle with your fragrance before committing to a larger order."
